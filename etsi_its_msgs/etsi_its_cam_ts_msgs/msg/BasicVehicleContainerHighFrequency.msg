# /**
# * This type contains detaild information of the Basic Vehicle Container High Frequency.
# *
# * It shall include the following components:
# *
# * @field heading: It represent the heading and heading accuracy of the vehicle movement of the originating ITS-S with regards to the true north. 
# * The heading accuracy provided in the heading Confidence value shall provide the accuracy of the measured vehicle heading with a confidence level 
# * of 95 %. Otherwise, the value of the headingConfidence shall be set to unavailable.
# *
# * @field speed: It represent driving speed and speed accuracy of the originating ITS-S. The speed accuracy provided in the speedConfidence shall 
# * provide the accuracy of the speed value with a confidence level of 95 %. Otherwise, the speedConfidence shall be set to unavailable.
# *
# * @field driveDirection: This component represent the vehicle drive direction (forward or backward) of the originating ITS-S.
# *
# * @field vehicleLength: This component represent the vehicle length value and vehicle length confidence indication of the vehicle ITS-S that 
# * originate the CAM. 
# *
# * @field vehicleWidth: This component represents the Vehicle Width of the vehicle ITS-S that originates the CAM excluding side mirrors and possible
# * similar extensions.
# *
# * @field longitudinalAcceleration: It represent the vehicle Longitudinal Acceleration of the originating ITS-S in the centre of the mass of the 
# * empty vehicle. It shall include the measured vehicle longitudinal acceleration and its accuracy value with the confidence level of 95 %. 
# * Otherwise, the longitudinalAccelerationConfidence shall be set to unavailable. 
# *
# * @field curvature: this component reppresent the actual trajectory of the vehicle. 
# *
# * @field curvatureCalculationMode: It indicates whether vehicle yaw-rate is used in the calculation of the curvature of the vehicle ITS-S that
# * originates the CAM.
# *
# * @field yawRate: It denotes the vehicle rotation around the centre of mass of the empty vehicle. The leading sign denotes the direction of 
# * rotation. The value is negative if the motion is clockwise when viewing from the top.
# * yawRateConfidence denotes the accuracy for the 95 % confidence level for the measured yawRateValue. Otherwise, the value of yawRateConfidence
# * shall be set to unavailable.
# *
# * @field accelerationControl: an optional component which represents the current status of the vehcile mechnanisms controlling the longitudinal movement of the vehcile ITS-S
# * (e.g. brake pedal,  gas pedal, etc. engaged) that originate the CAM.
# *
# * @field lanePosition: an optional component which represents the lanePosition of the referencePosition of a vehicle. This component shall be present if the data is 
# * available at the originating ITS-S.
# *
# * @field steeringWheelAngle: an optional component which indicates the steering wheel angle and accuracy as measured at the vehicle ITS-S that originates the CAM.
# *
# * @field lateralAcceleration: an optional component which represents the vehicle lateral acceleration of the originating ITS-S in the centre of the mass of the empty vehicle. 
# * It shall include the measured vehicle lateral acceleration and its accuracy value with the confidence level of 95%.
# *
# * @field verticalAcceleration: an optional component which indicates the originating ITS-S in the centre of the mass of the empty vehicle.
# * 
# * @field performanceClass: an optional component characterizes the maximum age of the CAM data elements with regard to the generation delta time.
# *
# * @field cenDsrcTollingZone: an optional component which represents the information about the position of a CEN DSRC Tolling Station operating in the 5,8 GHz frequency band.
