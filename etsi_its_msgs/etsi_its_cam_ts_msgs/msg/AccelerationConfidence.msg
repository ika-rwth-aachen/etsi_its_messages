# /**
#  * This DE indicates the acceleration confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an acceleration value with a default confidence level of 95 %. 
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 101`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `101` if the confidence value is out of range i.e. greater than 10 m/s^2,
#  * - `102` if the confidence value is unavailable.
#  *
#  * The value 0 shall not be used.
#  *
#  * @note: The fact that an acceleration value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(102)` can be caused by several reasons, such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the acceleration value may be valid and used by the application.
#  * 
#  * @note: If an acceleration value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(101)`, it means that the value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful for the application.
#  *
#  * @unit 0,1 m/s^2
#  * @category: Kinematic information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
