# * This DF describes radial shape details. The circular sector or cone is
# * constructed by sweeping the provided range about the position specified outside of the  
# * context of this DF. The range is swept between a horizontal start and a horizontal end angle in 
# * the X-Y plane of a right-hand cartesian coordinate system specified outside of the context of 
# * this DF, in positive angular direction w.r.t. the x-axis. A vertical opening angle in the X-Z 
# * plane may optionally be provided in positive angular direction w.r.t. the x-axis.
# * 
# * It shall include the following components:
# * 
# * @field range: the radial range of the sensor from the reference point or sensor point offset. 
# *
# * @field horizontalOpeningAngleStart:  the start of the shape's horizontal opening angle.
# *
# * @field horizontalOpeningAngleEnd: the end of the shape's horizontal opening angle. 
# *
# * @field verticalOpeningAngleStart: optional start of the shape's vertical opening angle. 
# *
# * @field verticalOpeningAngleEnd: optional end of the shape's vertical opening angle. 
# *
# * @category: Georeference information
# * @revision: created in V2.1.1, description revised and constraint added in V2.2.1
