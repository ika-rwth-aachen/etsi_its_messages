#  * This DE represents the value of the sub cause codes of the @ref CauseCode `railwayLevelCrossing` .
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `unavailable`                   - in case no further detailed information on the railway level crossing status is available,
#  * - 1 `doNotCrossAbnormalSituation`   - in case when something wrong is detected by equation or sensors of the railway level crossing, 
#                                          including level crossing is closed for too long (e.g. more than 10 minutes long ; default value),
#  * - 2 `closed`                        - in case the crossing is closed (barriers down),
#  * - 3 `unguarded`                     - in case the level crossing is unguarded (i.e a Saint Andrew cross level crossing without detection of train),
#  * - 4 `nominal`                       - in case the barriers are up and lights are off.
#  * - 5-255: reserved for future usage.
