#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 - `unavailable`                                        - in case further detailed information on the dangerous curve is unavailable,
#  * - 1 - `dangerousLeftTurnCurve`                             - in case the dangerous curve is a left turn curve,
#  * - 2 - `dangerousRightTurnCurve`                            - in case the dangerous curve is a right turn curve,
#  * - 3 - `multipleCurvesStartingWithUnknownTurningDirection`  - in case of multiple curves for which the starting curve turning direction is not known,
#  * - 4 - `multipleCurvesStartingWithLeftTurn`                 - in case of multiple curves starting with a left turn curve,
#  * - 5 - `multipleCurvesStartingWithRightTurn`                - in case of multiple curves starting with a right turn curve.

#  * 
#  * The definition of whether a curve is dangerous may vary according to region and according to vehicle types/mass
#  * and vehicle speed driving on the curve. This definition is out of scope of the present document.
