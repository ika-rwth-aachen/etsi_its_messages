# /**
#  * This DE describes the status of the exterior light switches of a vehicle incl. VRU vehicles.
#  *
#  * The corresponding bit shall be set to 1 under the following conditions:
#  * - 0 - `lowBeamHeadlightsOn`    - when the low beam head light switch is on,
#  * - 1 - `highBeamHeadlightsOn`   - when the high beam head light switch is on,
#  * - 2 - `leftTurnSignalOn`       - when the left turnSignal switch is on,
#  * - 3 - `rightTurnSignalOn`      - when the right turn signal switch is on,
#  * - 4 - `daytimeRunningLightsOn` - when the daytime running light switch is on,
#  * - 5 - `reverseLightOn`         - when the reverse light switch is on,
#  * - 6 - `fogLightOn`             - when the tail fog light switch is on,
#  * - 7 - `parkingLightsOn`        - when the parking light switch is on.
#  * 
#  * @note: The value of each bit indicates the state of the switch, which commands the corresponding light.
#  * The bit corresponding to a specific light is set to `1`, when the corresponding switch is turned on,
#  * either manually by the driver or automatically by a vehicle system. The bit value does not indicate
#  * if the corresponding lamps are alight or not.
#  * 
#  * If a vehicle is not equipped with a certain light or if the light switch status information is not available,
#  * the corresponding bit shall be set to `0`.
#  * 
#  * As the bit value indicates only the state of the switch, the turn signal and hazard signal bit values shall not
#  * alternate with the blinking interval.
#  * 
#  * For hazard indicator, the `leftTurnSignalOn (2)` and `rightTurnSignalOn (3)` shall be both set to `1`.
#  * 
#  * @category Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
