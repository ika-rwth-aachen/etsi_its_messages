# /**
#  * This DE indicates the heading confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of a heading value with a confidence level of 95 %.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 126`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 degree and more than (n-1) x 0,1 degree,
#  * - `126` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 12,5 degrees,
#  * - `127` if the confidence value information is not available.
#  * 
#  * @note:	The fact that a value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(127)` can be caused by several reasons,
#  * such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the heading value may be valid and used by the application.
#  *
#  * @note: If a heading value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(126)`, it means that the 
#  * heading value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful for the application.
#  * @note: this DE is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use the @ref Wgs84AngleConfidence instead. 
#  * 
#  * @unit: 0,1 degree
#  * @category: GeoReference information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
