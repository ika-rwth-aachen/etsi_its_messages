# * It shall include the following components: 
# * 
# * @field pointOfEventZone: the ordinal number of the point within the DF EventZone, i.e. within the list of EventPoints.
# *
# * @field path: the associated path towards the point specified in pointOfEventZone.
# * The first PathPoint presents an offset delta position with regards to the position of that pointOfEventZone.
