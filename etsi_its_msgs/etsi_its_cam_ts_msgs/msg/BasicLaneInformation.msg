# * This DF provides basic information about a single lane of a road segment.
# * It includes the following components: 
# * 
# * @field laneNumber: the number associated to the lane that provides a transversal identification. 
# * 
# * @field direction: the direction of traffic flow allowed on the lane. 
# * 
# * @field laneWidth: the optional width of the lane.
# *
# * @field connectingLane: the number of the connecting lane in the next road section, i.e. the number of the lane which the vehicle will use when travelling from one section to the next,
# * if it does not actively change lanes. If this component is absent, the lane name number remains the same in the next section.
# *
# * @field connectingRoadSection: the identifier of the next road section in direction of traffic, that is connecting to the current road section. 
# * If this component is absent, the connecting road section is the one following the instance where this DF is placed in the @ref RoadConfigurationSectionList.
# *
# * @category: Road topology information
