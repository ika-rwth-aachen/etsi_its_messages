# /**
#  * This DE provides information about the presence of a trailer. 
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `noTrailerPresent`                - to indicate that no trailer is present, i.e. either the vehicle is physically not enabled to tow a trailer or it has been detected that no trailer is present,
#  * - 1 `trailerPresentWithKnownLength`   - to indicate that a trailer has been detected as present and the length is  included in the vehicle length value,
#  * - 2 `trailerPresentWithUnknownLength` - to indicate that a trailer has been detected as present and the length is not included in the vehicle length value,
#  * - 3 `trailerPresenceIsUnknown`        - to indicate that information about the trailer presence is unknown, i.e. the vehicle is physically enabled to tow a trailer but the detection of trailer presence/absence is not possible,
#  * - 4 `unavailable`                     - to indicate that the information about the presence of a trailer is not available, i.e. it is neither known whether the vehicle is able to tow a trailer, 
#  *                                        nor the detection of trailer presence/absence is possible.
#  * 
#  * @note: this DE is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use the @ref TrailerPresenceInformation instead. 
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
