# * This DE indicates the approximate size of a VRU including the VRU vehicle used.
# * 
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - 0 `unavailable`    - to indicate that there is no matched size class or due to privacy reasons in profile 1, 
# * - 1 `low`            - to indicate that the VRU size class is low depending on the VRU profile,
# * - 2 `medium`         - to indicate that the VRU size class is medium depending on the VRU profile,
# * - 3 `high`           - to indicate that the VRU size class is high depending on the VRU profile.
# * - 4 to 15            - are reserved for future usage.
