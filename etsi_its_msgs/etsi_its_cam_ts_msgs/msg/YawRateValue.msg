# /**
#  * This DE represents the vehicle rotation around z-axis of the coordinate system centred on the centre of mass of the empty-loaded
#  * vehicle. The leading sign denotes the direction of rotation.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be provided in the vehicle coordinate system as defined in ISO 8855 [21], clause 2.11.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-32 766` to indicate that the yaw rate is equal to or greater than 327,66 degrees/second to the right,
#  * - `n` (`n > -32 766` and `n <= 0`) to indicate that the rotation is clockwise (i.e. to the right) and is equal to or less than n x 0,01 degrees/s, 
#       and greater than (n-1) x 0,01 degrees/s,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 32 766`) to indicate that the rotation is anti-clockwise (i.e. to the left) and is equal to or less than n x 0,01 degrees/s, 
#       and greater than (n-1) x 0,01 degrees/s,
#  * - `32 766` to indicate that the yaw rate is greater than 327.65 degrees/second to the left,
#  * - `32 767` to indicate that the information is not available.
#  * 
#  * The yaw rate value shall be a raw data value, i.e. not filtered, smoothed or otherwise modified.
#  * The reading instant should be the same as for the vehicle acceleration.
#  * 
#  * @note: The empty load vehicle is defined in ISO 1176 [8], clause 4.6.
#  * 
#  * @unit: 0,01 degree per second. 
#  * @category: Vehicle Information
#  * @revision: Desription revised in V2.1.1 (the meaning of 32766 has changed slightly).
