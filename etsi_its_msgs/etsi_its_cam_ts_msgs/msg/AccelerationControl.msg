# /**
#  * This DE indicates the current controlling mechanism for longitudinal movement of the vehicle.
#  * The data may be provided via the in-vehicle network. It indicates whether a specific in-vehicle
#  * acceleration control system is engaged or not. Currently, this DE includes the information of the
#  * vehicle brake pedal, gas pedal, emergency brake system, collision warning system, adaptive cruise
#  * control system, cruise control system and speed limiter system.
#  *
#  * The corresponding bit shall be set to 1 under the following conditions:
#  * - 0 - `brakePedalEngaged`      - Driver is stepping on the brake pedal,
#  * - 1 - `gasPedalEngaged`        - Driver is stepping on the gas pedal,
#  * - 2 - `emergencyBrakeEngaged`  - emergency brake system is engaged,
#  * - 3 - `collisionWarningEngaged`- collision warning system is engaged,
#  * - 4 - `accEngaged`             - ACC is engaged,
#  * - 5 - `cruiseControlEngaged`   - cruise control is engaged,
#  * - 6 - `speedLimiterEngaged`    - speed limiter is engaged.
#  *
#  * Otherwise (for example when the corresponding system is not available due to non equipped system
#  * or information is unavailable), the corresponding bit shall be set to 0.
#  *
#  * @note: The system engagement condition is OEM specific and therefore out of scope of the present document.
#  * @category: Vehicle information
