# *
# * This DF represents the top-level DF to represent a lane position. A lane position is a transversal position on the carriageway at a specific longitudinal position, in resolution of lanes of the carriageway.
# *
# * @note: This DF is the most general way to represent a lane position: it provides a complete set of information regarding a transversal (dimensionless) position on the carriageway at a specific 
# * reference position, i.e. it provides different options and synonyms to represent the lane at which the reference position (the point) is located. A confidence is used to describe the probability 
# * that the object is located in the provided lane. The dimension of the object or extension of an area are not considered: See @ref OccupiedLanesWithConfidence for describing the occupation of lanes, 
# * where the dimensions of an object or the extension of an area is considered.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field lanePositionBased: lane position information for a defined reference position.
# * 
# * @field mapBased: optional lane position information described in the context of a MAPEM as specified in ETSI TS 103 301 [15]. 
# * If present, it shall describe the same reference position using the lane identification in the MAPEM. This component can be used only if a MAPEM is available for the reference position 
# * (e.g. on an intersection): In this case it is used as a synonym to the mandatory component lanePositionBased. 
# * 
# * @field confidence: confidence information for expressing the probability that the object is located at the indicated lane.  
# * If the value of the component lanePositionBased is generated directly from the absolute reference position and reference topology information, 
# * no sensor shall be indicated in the component usedDetectionInformation of the @ref MetaInformation.
# *
# * @category: Road Topology information
# * @revision: newly created in V2.2.1. The previous DF GeneralizedLanePosition is now renamed to @ref LanePositionOptions.
