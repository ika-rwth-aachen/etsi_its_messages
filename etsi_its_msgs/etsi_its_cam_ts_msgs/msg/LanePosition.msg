# /**
#  * This DE indicates a transversal position on the carriageway at a specific longitudinal position, in resolution of lanes of the carriageway. 
#  *
#  * For right-hand traffic roads, the value shall be set to:
#  * - `-1` if the position is off, i.e. besides the road,
#  * - `0` if the position is on the inner hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to the leftmost lane,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 14`), if the position is on the n-th driving lane counted from the leftmost lane to the rightmost lane of a specific traffic direction,
#  * - `14` if the position is on the outer hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to rightmost lane (if present).
#  *
#  * For left-hand traffic roads, the value shall be set to:
#  * - `-1` if the position is off, i.e. besides the road,
#  * - `0` if the position is on the inner hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to the rightmost lane,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 14`), if the position is on the n-th driving lane counted from the rightmost lane to the leftmost lane of a specific traffic direction,
#  * - `14` if the position is on the outer hard shoulder, i.e. the hard should adjacent to leftmost lane (if present).
#  *
#  *  @note: in practice this means that the position is counted from "inside" to "outside" no matter which traffic practice is used.
#  *
#  * If the carriageway allows only traffic in one direction (e.g. in case of dual or multiple carriageway roads), the position is counted from the physical border of the carriageway. 
#  * If the carriageway allows traffic in both directions and there is no physical delimitation between traffic directions (e.g. on a single carrriageway road), 
#  * the position is counted from the legal (i.e. optical) separation between traffic directions (horizontal marking). 
#  *
#  * If not indicated otherwise (by lane markings or traffic signs), the legal separation on carriageways allowing traffic on both directions is identified as follows:
#  * - If the total number of lanes N is even, the lanes are divided evenly between the traffic directions starting from the outside of the carriageway on both sides and the 
#  *   imaginary separation between traffic directions is on the border between the even number of lanes N/2.
#  * - If the total number of lanes N is odd, the lanes are divided evenly between traffic direction starting from the outside of the carriageway on both sides. 
#  *   The remaining middle lane is assigned to both traffic directions as innermost lane.
#  *

#  * @revision: Description of the legal separation of carriageways added in V2.2.1
