# /**
#  * This DE represents the steering wheel angle of the vehicle at certain point in time.
#  * The value shall be provided in the vehicle coordinate system as defined in ISO 8855 [21], clause 2.11.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-511` if the steering wheel angle is equal to or greater than 511 x 1,5 degrees = 766,5 degrees to the right,
#  * - `n` (`n > -511` and `n <= 0`) if  the steering wheel angle is equal to or less than n x 1,5 degrees, and greater than (n-1) x 1,5 degrees, 
#       turning clockwise (i.e. to the right),
#  * - `n` (`n >= 1` and `n < 511`) if the steering wheel angle is equal to or less than n x 0,1 degrees, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 degrees, 
#       turning counter-clockwise (i.e. to the left),
#  * - `511` if the steering wheel angle is greater than 510 x 1,5 degrees = 765 degrees to the left,
#  * - `512` if information is not available.
#  *
#  * @unit: 1,5 degree
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1 (meaning of value 511 has changed slightly).
