# /**
#  * This DE describes vehicle turning curve with the following information:
#  * ```
#  *     Value = 1 / Radius * 10000
#  * ```
#  * wherein radius is the vehicle turning curve radius in metres. 
#  * 
#  * Positive values indicate a turning curve to the left hand side of the driver.
#  * It corresponds to the vehicle coordinate system as defined in ISO 8855 [21].
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-1023` for  values smaller than -1023,
#  * - `n` (`n > -1023` and `n < 0`) for negative values equal to or less than `n`, and greater than `(n-1)`,
#  * - `0` when the vehicle is moving straight,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 1022`) for positive values equal to or less than `n`, and greater than `(n-1)`,
#  * - `1022`, for values  greater than 1021,
#  * - `1023`, if the information is not available.
#  * 
#  * @note: The present DE is limited to vehicle types as defined in ISO 8855 [21].
#  * 
#  * @unit: 1 over 10 000 metres
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: description revised in V2.1.1 (the definition of value 1022 has changed slightly)
