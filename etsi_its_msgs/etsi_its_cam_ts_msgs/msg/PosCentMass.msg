# * This DE indicates the perpendicular distance from the centre of mass of an empty load vehicle to the front line of
# * the vehicle bounding box of the empty load vehicle.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 62`) for any aplicable value n between 0,1 metre and 6,2 metres, 
# * - `62` for values equal to or higher than 6.1 metres,
# * - `63`  if the information is unavailable.
