# /**
#  * This DE represents the absolute geographical latitude in a WGS84 coordinate system, providing a range of 90 degrees in north or
#  * in south hemisphere.
#  * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n >= -900 000 000` and `n < 0`) x 10^-7 degree, i.e. negative values for latitudes south of the Equator,
#  * - `0` is used for the latitude of the equator,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 900 000 001`) x 10^-7 degree, i.e. positive values for latitudes north of the Equator,
#  * - `900 000 001` when the information is unavailable.
#  *
#  * @unit: 10^-7 degree
#  * @category: GeoReference information
