# /**
#  * This DE indicates the acceleration confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy range of a curvature value with a confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 - `onePerMeter-0-00002` - if the confidence value is less than or equal to 0,00002 m-1,
#  * - 1 - `onePerMeter-0-0001`  - if the confidence value is less than or equal to 0,0001 m-1 and greater than 0,00002 m-1,
#  * - 2 - `onePerMeter-0-0005`  - if the confidence value is less than or equal to 0,0005 m-1 and greater than 0,0001 m-1,
#  * - 3 - `onePerMeter-0-002`   - if the confidence value is less than or equal to 0,002 m-1 and greater than 0,0005 m-1,
#  * - 4 - `nePerMeter-0-01`     - if the confidence value is less than or equal to 0,01 m-1 and greater than 0,002 m-1,
#  * - 5 - `nePerMeter-0-1`      - if the confidence value is less than or equal to 0,1 m-1  and greater than 0,01 m-1,
#  * - 6 - `outOfRange`          - if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 0,1 m-1,
#  * - 7 - `unavailable`         - if the confidence value is not available.
#  * 
#  * @note:	The fact that a curvature value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(7)` can be caused by
#  * several reasons, such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the curvature value may be valid and used by the application.
#  * 
#  * @note: If a curvature value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(6)`, it means that the curvature value is not valid 
#  * and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful for the application.
#  * 
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
