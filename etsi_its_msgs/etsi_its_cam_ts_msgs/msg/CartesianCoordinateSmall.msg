# * This DF represents the value of a cartesian coordinate with a range of -30,94 metres to +10,00 metres.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `3094` if the longitudinal offset is out of range, i.e. less than or equal to -30,94 metres,
# * - `n` (`n > -3 094` and `n < 1 001`) if the longitudinal offset information is equal to or less than n x 0,01 metre and more than (n-1) x 0,01 metre,
# * - `1001` if the longitudinal offset is out of range, i.e. greater than 10 metres.
