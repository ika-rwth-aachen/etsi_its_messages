# *
# * This DF describes a radial shape. The circular or spherical sector is constructed by sweeping      
# * the provided range about the reference position specified outside of the context of this DF or 
# * about the optional shapeReferencePoint. The range is swept between a horizontal start and a 
# * horizontal end angle in the X-Y plane of a cartesian coordinate system specified outside of the 
# * context of this DF, in a right-hand positive angular direction w.r.t. the x-axis. 
# * A vertical opening angle in the X-Z plane may optionally be provided in a right-hand positive 
# * angular direction w.r.t. the x-axis. 
# *
# * It shall include the following components:
# * 
# * @field shapeReferencePoint: the optional reference point used for the definition of the shape, 
# * relative to an externally specified reference position. If this component is absent, the  
# * externally specified reference position represents the shape's reference point. 
# *
# * @field range: the radial range of the shape from the shape's reference point. 
# *
# * @field horizontalOpeningAngleStart: the start of the shape's horizontal opening angle. 
# *
# * @field horizontalOpeningAngleEnd: the end of the shape's horizontal opening angle. 
# *
# * @field verticalOpeningAngleStart: optional start of the shape's vertical opening angle. 
# *
# * @field verticalOpeningAngleEnd: optional end of the shape's vertical opening angle. 
# *
# * @category GeoReference information
# * @revision: created in V2.1.1, names and types of the horizontal opening angles changed, constraint added and description revised in V2.2.1
