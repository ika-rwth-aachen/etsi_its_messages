# /**
#  * This DE indicates the steering wheel angle confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy for a  steering wheel angle value with a confidence level of 95 %.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 126`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 1,5 degrees,
#  * - `126` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 187,5 degrees,
#  * - `127` if the confidence value is not available.
#  * 
#  * @note: The fact that a steering wheel angle value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(127)`
#  * can be caused by several reasons, such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the steering wheel angle value may be valid and used by the application.
#  * 
#  * If a steering wheel angle value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(126)`,
#  * it means that the steering wheel angle value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted.
#  * Such value is not useful for the application.
#  * 
#  * @unit: 1,5 degree
#  * @category: Vehicle Information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
