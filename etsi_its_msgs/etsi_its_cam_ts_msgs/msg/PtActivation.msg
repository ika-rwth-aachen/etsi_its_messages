# /**
#  * This DF represents activation data for real-time systems designed for operations control, traffic light priorities, track switches, barriers, etc.
#  * using a range of activation devices equipped in public transport vehicles.
#  *
#  * The activation of the corresponding equipment is triggered by the approach or passage of a public transport
#  * vehicle at a certain point (e.g. a beacon).
#  *
#  * @field ptActivationType: type of activation. 
#  *
#  * @field ptActicationData: data of activation. 
#  *
#  * Today there are different payload variants defined for public transport activation-data. The R09.x is one of
#  * the industry standard used by public transport vehicles (e.g. buses, trams) in Europe (e.g. Germany Austria)
#  * for controlling traffic lights, barriers, bollards, etc. This DF shall include information like route, course,
#  * destination, priority, etc.
#  * 
#  * The R09.x content is defined in VDV recommendation 420 [7]. It includes following information:
#  * - Priority Request Information (pre-request, request, ready to start)
#  * - End of Prioritization procedure
#  * - Priority request direction
#  * - Public Transport line number
#  * - Priority of public transport
#  * - Route line identifier of the public transport
#  * - Route number identification
#  * - Destination of public transport vehicle
#  *
#  * Other countries may use different message sets defined by the local administration.
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: V1.3.1
