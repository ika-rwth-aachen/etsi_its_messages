#  * This DE represents an offset longitude with regards to a defined longitude value.
#  * It may be used to describe a geographical point with regards to a specific reference geographical position.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n >= -131 071` and `n < 0`) for offset n x 10^-7 degree towards the west from the reference position,
#  * - `0` for no longitudinal offset,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 131 072`) for offset n x 10^-7 degree towards the east from the reference position, 
#  * - `131 072` when the information is unavailable.
