# /** 
#  * This type contains detailed information about an object with which a vehicle and/or the traffic is likely to collide.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field perceivedPreCrashObject: information about a perceived object in the East, North, Up reference frame.
#  *
#  * @field objectStationId: the optional station Id of the object for which the information is provided.
#  *
#  * @field timeToCollision: the optional estimated time to collision of a vehicle with the object. 
#  *
#  * @field impactSection: indication of the object's section where the impact will most likely occur. 
#  * When the target object is likely to be a vehicle, then this component should be present, otherwise it should not be provided.  
#  *
#  * @field estimatedBrakingDistance: the optional estimated distance in which the vehicle would need to come to a complete hold, 
#  * if no obstruction was in the way.
