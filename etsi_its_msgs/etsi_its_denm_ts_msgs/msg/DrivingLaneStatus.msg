# /**
#  * This DE indicates whether a driving lane is open to traffic.
#  * 
#  * A lane is counted from inside border of the road excluding the hard shoulder. The size of the bit string shall
#  * correspond to the total number of the driving lanes in the carriageway.
#  * 
#  * The numbering is matched to @ref LanePosition.
#  * The bit `0` is used to indicate the innermost lane, bit `1` is used to indicate the second lane from inside border.
#  * 
#  * If a lane is closed to traffic, the corresponding bit shall be set to `1`. Otherwise, it shall be set to `0`.
#  * 
#  * @note: hard shoulder status is not provided by this DE but in @ref HardShoulderStatus.
#  * 
#  * @category: Traffic information
#  * @revision: V1.3.1
