# /** 
#  * This DF represents the Euler angles which describe the orientation of an object bounding box in a Cartesian coordinate system with an associated confidence level for each angle.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field zAngle: z-angle of object bounding box at the time of measurement, with the associated confidence.
#  * The angle is measured with positive values considering the object orientation turning around the z-axis using the right-hand rule, starting from the x-axis. 
#  * This extrinsic rotation shall be applied around the centre point of the object bounding box before all other rotations.
#  *
#  * @field yAngle: optional y-angle of object bounding box at the time of measurement, with the associated confidence.
#  * The angle is measured with positive values considering the object orientation turning around the y-axis using the right-hand rule, starting from the z-axis. 
#  * This extrinsic rotation shall be applied around the centre point of the object bounding box after the rotation by zAngle and before the rotation by xAngle.
#  *
#  * @field xAngle: optional x-angle of object bounding box at the time of measurement, with the associated confidence.
#  * The angle is measured with positive values considering the object orientation turning around the x-axis using the right-hand rule, starting from the z-axis. 
#  * This extrinsic rotation shall be applied around the centre point of the object bounding box after all other rotations.
