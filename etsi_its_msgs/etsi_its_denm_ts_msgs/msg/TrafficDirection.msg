# /**
#  * This DE indicates a direction of traffic with respect to a reference direction, and a portion of that traffic with respect to a reference position.

#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `allTrafficDirections`                                    - for all directions of traffic, 
#  * - 1 `sameAsReferenceDirection-upstreamOfReferencePosition`    - for the direction of traffic according to the reference direction, and the portion of traffic upstream of the reference position, 
#  * - 2 `sameAsReferenceDirection-downstreamOfReferencePosition`  - for the direction of traffic according to the reference direction, and the portion of traffic downstream of the reference position, 
#  * - 3 `oppositeToReferenceDirection`                            - for the direction of traffic opposite to the reference direction. 
#  *
#  * @note: Upstream traffic corresponds to the incoming traffic towards the event position, and downstream traffic to the departing traffic away from the event position.
#  * @category: GeoReference information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.1.1 from RelevanceTrafficDirection, description and naming of values changed in V2.2.1
