# --- ASN.1 Definition ---------------------------------------------------------
# /** 
#  * This DF represents the shape of a rectangular area or a right rectangular prism that is centred 
#  * on a reference position defined outside of the context of this DF and oriented w.r.t. a cartesian    
#  * coordinate system defined outside of the context of this DF. 
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  * 
#  * @field shapeReferencePoint: represents an optional offset point which the rectangle is centred on with 
#  * respect to the reference position. If this component is absent, the externally specified  
#  * reference position represents the shape's reference point. 
#  *
#  * @field semiLength: represents half the length of the rectangle located in the X-Y Plane.
#  * 
#  * @field semiBreadth: represents half the breadth of the rectangle located in the X-Y Plane.
#  *
#  * @field orientation: represents the optional orientation of the length of the rectangle, 
#  * measured with positive values turning around the Z-axis using the right-hand rule, starting from
#  * the X-axis. 
#  *
#  * @field height: represents the optional height, present if the shape is a right rectangular prism 
#  * with height extending in the positive Z-axis.
#  *
#  * @category GeoReference information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1, centerPoint renamed to shapeReferencePoint, the type of the field orientation changed and description revised in V2.2.1
