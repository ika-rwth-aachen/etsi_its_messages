# The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0  - `unavailable`     - in case further detailed information on the road surface condition is unavailable,
#  * - 1  - `rockfalls`       - in case rock falls are detected on the road surface,
#  * - 2  - `earthquakeDamage`- in case the road surface is damaged by earthquake,
#  * - 3  - `sewerCollapse`   - in case of sewer collapse on the road surface,
#  * - 4  - `subsidence`      - in case road surface is damaged by subsidence,
#  * - 5  - `snowDrifts`      - in case road surface is damaged due to snow drift,
#  * - 6  - `stormDamage`     - in case road surface is damaged by strong storm,
#  * - 7  - `burstPipe`       - in case road surface is damaged due to pipe burst,
#  * - 8  - `volcanoEruption` - in case road surface is damaged due to volcano eruption,
#  * - 9  - `fallingIce`      - in case road surface damage is due to falling ice,
#  * - 10 - `fire`            - in case there is fire on or near to the road surface.
