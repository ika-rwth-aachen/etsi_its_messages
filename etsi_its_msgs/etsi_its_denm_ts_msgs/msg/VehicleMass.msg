# /**
#  * This DE represents the mass of an empty loaded vehicle.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to: 
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 1023`) to indicate that the applicable value is equal to or less than n x 10^5 gramm, and greater than (n-1) x 10^5 gramm,
#  * - `1 023` indicates that the vehicle mass is greater than 102 200 000 g,
#  * - `1 024` indicates  the vehicle mass information is unavailable.
#  * 
#  * @note:	The empty load vehicle is defined in ISO 1176 [8], clause 4.6.
#  * 
#  * @unit: 10^5 gramm
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Description updated in V2.1.1 (the meaning of 1 023 has changed slightly).
