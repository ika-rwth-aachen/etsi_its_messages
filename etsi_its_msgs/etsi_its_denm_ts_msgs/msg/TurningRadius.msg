# /**
#  * This DE represents the smallest circular turn (i.e. U-turn) that the vehicle is capable of making.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 254`) to indicate the applicable value is equal to or less than n x 0,4 metre, and greater than (n-1) x 0,4 metre,
#  * - `254` to indicate that the turning radius is  greater than 253 x 0,4 metre = 101.2 metres,
#  * - `255` to indicate that the information is unavailable.
#  * 
#  * For vehicle with tracker, the turning radius applies to the vehicle only.
#  *
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @unit 0,4 metre
#  * @revision: Description revised V2.1.1 (the meaning of 254 has changed slightly)
