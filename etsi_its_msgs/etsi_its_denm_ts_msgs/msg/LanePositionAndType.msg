#  * @field transversalPosition: the transversal position.
#  * 
#  * @field laneType: the type of the lane identified in the component transversalPosition. By default set to `traffic`.
#  *
#  * @field direction: the traffic direction for the lane position relative to a defined reference direction. By default set to `sameDirection`, i.e. following the reference direction.
#  *
#  * @category Road topology information
#  * @revision: direction added in V2.2.1
