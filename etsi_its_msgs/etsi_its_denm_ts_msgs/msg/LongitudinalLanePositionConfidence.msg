# /** 
#  * This DE indicates the longitudinal lane position confidence value which represents the estimated accuracy of longitudinal lane position measurement with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 1 022`) if the  confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 m, and more than (n-1) x 0,1 m,
#  * - `1 022` if the confidence value is out of range i.e. greater than 102,1 m,
#  * - `1 023` if the confidence value is unavailable.
#  *
#  * @unit 0,1 metre
