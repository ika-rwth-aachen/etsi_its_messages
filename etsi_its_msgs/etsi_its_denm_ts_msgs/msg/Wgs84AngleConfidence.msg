# /** 
#  * This DE indicates the angle confidence value which represents the estimated accuracy of an angle value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n >= 1` and `n < 126`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 degrees and more than (n-1) x 0,1 degrees,
#  * - `126` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 12,5 degrees,
#  * - `127` if the confidence value is not available.
#  *
