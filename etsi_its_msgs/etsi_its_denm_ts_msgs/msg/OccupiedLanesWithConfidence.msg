# /**
#  * This DF represents a set of lanes which are partially or fully occupied by an object or event at an externally defined reference position. 
#  *
#  * @note: In contrast to @ref GeneralizedLanePosition, the dimension of the object or event area (width and length) is taken into account to determine the occupancy, 
#  * i.e. this DF describes the lanes which are blocked by an object or event and not the position of the object / event itself. A confidence is used to describe the 
#  * probability that exactly all the provided lanes are occupied. 
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field lanePositionBased: a set of up to `4` lanes that are partially or fully occupied by an object or event, ordered by increasing value of @ref LanePosition. 
#  * Lanes that are partially occupied can be described using the component lanePositionWithLateralDetails of @ref  Options, with the following constraints: 
#  * The distance to lane borders which are covered by the object / event shall be set to 0. Only the distances to the leftmost and/or rightmost border which are not covered by 
#  * the object / event shall be provided with values > 0. Those values shall be added to the respective instances of @ref LanePositionOptions, i.e. the first entry shall contain the component distanceToLeftBorder > 0 , 
#  * and/or the last entry shall contain the component distanceToRightBorder > 0; the respective other components of these entries shall be set to 0.
#  * 
#  * @field mapBased: optional lane information described in the context of a MAPEM as specified in ETSI TS 103 301 [15]. 
#  * If present, it shall describe the same lane(s) as listed in the component lanePositionBased, but using the lane identification of the MAPEM. This component can be used only if a 
#  * MAPEM is available for the reference position (e.g. on an intersection): In this case it is used as a synonym to the mandatory component lanePositionBased. 
#  *
#  * @field confidence: mandatory confidence information for expressing the probability that all the provided lanes are occupied. It also provides information on how the lane 
#  * information were generated. If none of the sensors were used, the lane information is assumed to be derived directly from the absolute reference position and the related dimension.
#  *
#  * @category: Road Topology information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.2.1
