# /** 
#  * This DE indicates the object dimension confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an object dimension value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 31`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n x 0,1 metre, and more than (n-1) x 0,1 metre,
#  * - `31` if the confidence value is out of range i.e. greater than 3,0 m,
#  * - `32` if the confidence value is unavailable.
