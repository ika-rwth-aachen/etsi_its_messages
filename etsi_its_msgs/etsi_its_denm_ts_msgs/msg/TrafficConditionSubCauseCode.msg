#  * This DE represents the value of the sub cause codes of the @ref CauseCode `trafficCondition`. 
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `unavailable`                  - in case further detailed information on the traffic condition is unavailable,
#  * - 1 `increasedVolumeOfTraffic`     - in case the type of traffic condition is increased traffic volume,
#  * - 2 `trafficJamSlowlyIncreasing`   - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is increasing slowly,
#  * - 3 `trafficJamIncreasing`         - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is increasing,
#  * - 4 `trafficJamStronglyIncreasing` - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is strongly increasing,
#  * - 5 `trafficJam`         `         - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam and no further detailed information about its volume is available,
#  * - 6 `trafficJamSlightlyDecreasing` - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is decreasing slowly,
#  * - 7 `trafficJamDecreasing`         - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is decreasing,
#  * - 8 `trafficJamStronglyDecreasing` - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is decreasing rapidly,
#  * - 9 `trafficJamStable`             - in case the traffic condition is a traffic jam with stable volume,
#  * - 10-255: reserved for future usage.
