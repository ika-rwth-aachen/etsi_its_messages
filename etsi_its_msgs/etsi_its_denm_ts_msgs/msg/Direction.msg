#  * Example: a reference direction may be implicitly defined by the definition of a geographical zone.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 - `sameDirection`     - to indicate the same direction as the reference direction,
#  * - 1 - `oppositeDirection` - to indicate opposite direction as the reference direction,
#  * - 2 - `bothDirections`    - to indicate both directions, i.e. the same and the opposite direction,
#  * - 3 - `unavailable`       - to indicate that the information is unavailable.
