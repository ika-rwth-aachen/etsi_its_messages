#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 - `unavailable`     - in case information on the cause of the low road adhesion is unavailable,
#  * - 1 - `heavyFrostOnRoad`- in case the low road adhesion is due to heavy frost on the road,
#  * - 2 - `fuelOnRoad`      - in case the low road adhesion is due to fuel on the road,
#  * - 3 - `mudOnRoad`       - in case the low road adhesion is due to mud on the road,
#  * - 4 - `snowOnRoad`      - in case the low road adhesion is due to snow on the road,
#  * - 5 - `iceOnRoad`       - in case the low road adhesion is due to ice on the road,
#  * - 6 - `blackIceOnRoad`  - in case the low road adhesion is due to black ice on the road,
#  * - 7 - `oilOnRoad`       - in case the low road adhesion is due to oil on the road,
#  * - 8 - `looseChippings`  - in case the low road adhesion is due to loose gravel or stone fragments detached from a road surface or from a hazard,
#  * - 9 - `instantBlackIce` - in case the low road adhesion is due to instant black ice on the road surface,
#  * - 10 - `roadsSalted`    - when the low road adhesion is due to salted road,
