# /** 
#  * This type represents the Management Container.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field actionId: the identifier of the DENM.
#  *
#  * @field detectionTime: the time at which the event is detected.
#  *
#  * @field referenceTime: the time at which a new DENM, an update DENM or a cancellation DENM is generated
#  *
#  * @field termination: the optional termination type of the DENM.
#  *
#  * @field eventPosition: the geographical position used in the definition of the awareness area / relevance zone, see clause 6.1.3.
#  *
#  * @field awarenessDistance: the optional radius of the circular awareness area, with centre at the event position or at any of the 
#  * event history points as defined in clause 6.1.3.1.
#  *
#  * @field trafficDirection: the optional traffic direction along which the receiving ITS-S may encounter the event, 
#  * as defined in clause 6.1.3.
#  *
#  * @field validityDuration: the validity duration of a DENM. This component represents a time offset in the unit of second since detectionTime.
#  *
#  * @field transmissionInterval: the optional time interval for DENM transmission as defined by the originating ITS-S. 
#  * If the component is not present in DENM, a default value defaultValidity is assumed.
#  *
#  * @field stationType: the station type information of the originating ITS-S.
#  *
