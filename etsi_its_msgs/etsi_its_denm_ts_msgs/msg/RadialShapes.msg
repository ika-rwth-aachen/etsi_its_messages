#  * This DF describes a list of radial shapes positioned w.r.t. to an offset position defined  
#  * relative to a reference position specified outside of the context of this DF and oriented w.r.t.  
#  * a cartesian coordinate system specified outside of the context of this DF. 
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components:
#  *
#  * @field refPointId: the identification of the reference point in case of a sensor mounted to trailer. Defaults to ITS ReferencePoint (0).
#  * 
#  * @field xCoordinate: the x-coordinate of the offset position.
#  *
#  * @field yCoordinate: the y-coordinate of the offset position.
#  *
#  * @field zCoordinate: the optional z-coordinate of the offset position.
#  *
#  * @field radialShapesList: the list of radial shape details.
#  *
#  * @category: Georeference information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1, description revised in V2.2.1
