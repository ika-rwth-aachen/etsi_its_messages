# /** 
#  * This type contains detailed information about the vehicle in which the originating ITS-S is mounted, for mitigating the consequences 
#  * of a collision.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field heightLonCarrLeft: the height of the left longitudinal carrier of the vehicle from base to top.
#  *
#  * @field heightLonCarrRight: the height of the right longitudinal carrier of the vehicle from base to top.
#  *
#  * @field posLonCarrLeft: the position of the left longitudinal carrier of vehicle.
#  *
#  * @field posLonCarrRight: the position of the right longitudinal carrier of vehicle.
#  *
#  * @field positionOfPillars: information about the vertical support of the vehicle in which the originating ITS-S is mounted. It shall be 
#  * included for passenger vehicles only.
#  *
#  * @field posCentMass: the position of the centre of mass of the vehicle.
#  *
#  * @field wheelBaseVehicle: the wheel base of the vehicle.
#  *
#  * @field turningRadius: the turning radius of the vehicle.
#  *
#  * @field posFrontAx: the position of the front axle of the vehicle.
#  *
#  * @field positionOfOccupants: indicates whether an in-vehicle seat is occupied at the moment of generation of the message.
#  *
#  * @field vehicleMass: the mass of the unloaded vehicle
#  *
#  * @field requestResponseIndication: indicates whether the originating ITS-S transmitting the impactReduction component is requesting 
#  * the receiving ITS-S to provide also its impactReduction component.
#  *
