# /** 
#  * This DE indicates the angular speed confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an angular speed value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  * For correlation computation, maximum interval levels can be assumed.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 - `degSec-01`   - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 1 degree/second,
#  * - 1 - `degSec-02`   - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 2 degrees/second and greater than 1 degree/second,
#  * - 2 - `degSec-05`   - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 5 degrees/second and greater than 2 degrees/second,
#  * - 3 - `degSec-10`   - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 10 degrees/second and greater than 5 degrees/second,
#  * - 4 - `degSec-20`   - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 20 degrees/second and greater than 10 degrees/second,
#  * - 5 - `degSec-50`   - if the accuracy is equal to or less than 50 degrees/second and greater than 20 degrees/second,
#  * - 6 - `outOfRange`  - if the accuracy is out of range, i.e. greater than 50 degrees/second,
#  * - 7 - `unavailable` - if the accuracy information is unavailable.
