# /** 
#  * This type contains detailed information of a roadwork zone and specific access conditions.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field lightBarSirenInUse: optionally indicates whether a roadwork vehicle has switched on the light bar or siren. 
#  * It is used when the roadwork involves a specific roadwork vehicle
#  *
#  * @field closedLanes: optionally indicates whether the roadwork has caused the closure of one or several driving lanes. 
#  * Optionally, it may indicate whether a hard shoulder lane is closed to traffic or can be used for specific usage (e.g. for stopping).
#  *
#  * @field restriction: the optional type(s) of vehicles that are restricted to access the road work zone. 
#  * More than one vehicle types may be provided by this component if the restriction apply to multiple vehicle types. 
#  *
#  * @field speedLimit: the optional speed limitation applied to the roadwork zone.
#  *
#  * @field incidentIndication: the optional incident related to the roadworks to provide additional information of the roadworks zone.
#  *
#  * @field recommendedPath: the optional recommended itinerary in order to contour the roadworks zone. If present, a recommended path 
#  * shall be a list of path points in the order from the starting point closest to the roadworks zone to the end point of the recommended path. 
#  *
#  * @field startingPointSpeedLimit: the optional effective starting position of a speed limit being applied to the roadwork zone, 
#  * with respect to the component eventPosition on the Management Container.
#  * This component shall be present if the speed limit is applied at a certain distance prior to the roadwork zone starting position.
#  *
#  * @field trafficFlowRule: optionally indicates the side of the road to which the traffic should flow around a roadwork.
#  *
#  * @field referenceDenms: an optional sequence of actionIds for different DENMs that describe the same event. 
#  * If it is available, it indicates the actionIds of all other DENMs describing this event.
#  *
