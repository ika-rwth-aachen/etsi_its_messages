#  * - 1 - `electricEnergyStorage` - when electric energy is being used and stored in vehicle,
#  * - 2 - `liquidPropaneGas`      - when liquid Propane Gas (LPG) is being used and stored in vehicle,   
#  * - 3 - `compressedNaturalGas ` - when compressedNaturalGas (CNG) is being used and stored in vehicle,
