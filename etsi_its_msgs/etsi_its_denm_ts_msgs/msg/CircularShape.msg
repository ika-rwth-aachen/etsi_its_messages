#  * @field shapeReferencePoint: optional reference point that represents the centre of the circle, relative to an externally specified reference position. 
#  * If this component is absent, the externally specified reference position represents the shape's reference point. 
#  *
#  * @field radius: the radius of the circular area.
#  *
#  * @field height: the optional height, present if the shape is a right cylinder extending in the positive z-axis.
