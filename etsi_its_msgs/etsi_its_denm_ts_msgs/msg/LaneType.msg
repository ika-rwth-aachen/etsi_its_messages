# /**
#  * This DE represents the type of a lane. 
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0	- `traffic`            - Lane dedicated to the movement of vehicles,
#  * - 1	- `through`            - Lane dedicated to the movement of vehicles travelling ahead and not turning,
#  * - 2	- `reversible`         - Lane where the direction of traffic can be changed to match the peak flow,
#  * - 3	- `acceleration`	   - Lane that allows vehicles entering a road to accelerate to the speed of through traffic before merging with it,
#  * - 4	- `deceleration`       - Lane that allows vehicles exiting a road to decelerate before leaving it,
#  * - 5	- `leftHandTurning`    - Lane reserved for slowing down and making a left turn, so as not to disrupt traffic,
#  * - 6	- `rightHandTurning`   - Lane reserved for slowing down and making a right turn so as not to disrupt traffic,
#  * - 7	- `dedicatedVehicle`   - Lane dedicated to movement of motor vehicles with specific characteristics, such as heavy goods vehicles, etc., 
#  * - 8	- `bus`                - Lane dedicated to movement of buses providing public transport,
#  * - 9	- `taxi`               - Lane dedicated to movement of taxis,
#  * - 10	- `hov`                - Carpooling lane or high occupancy vehicle lane,
#  * - 11	- `hot`                - High occupancy vehicle lanes that is allowed to be used without meeting the occupancy criteria by paying a toll,
#  * - 12	- `pedestrian`         - Lanes dedicated to pedestrians such as pedestrian sidewalk paths,
#  * - 13	- `cycleLane`	       - Lane dedicated to exclusive or preferred use by bicycles,
#  * - 14	- `median`             - Lane not dedicated to movement of vehicles but representing a median / central reservation  such as the central median, 
#                                  separating the two directional carriageways of the highway,
#  * - 15	- `striping`	       - Lane not dedicated to movement of vehicles but covered with roadway markings,
#  * - 16	- `trackedVehicle`     - Lane dedicated to movement of trains, trams and trolleys,
#  * - 17	- `parking`            - Lanes dedicated to vehicles parking, stopping and loading lanes,
#  * - 18	- `emergency`          - Lane dedicated to vehicles in breakdown or to emergency vehicles also called hard shoulder,
#  * - 19	- `verge`              - Lane representing the verge, i.e. a narrow strip of grass or plants and sometimes also trees located between 
#                                  the road surface edge and the boundary of a road,
#  * - 20	`minimumRiskManoeuvre` - Lane dedicated to automated vehicles making a minimum risk manoeuvre,
#  * - 21	`separatedCycleLane`   - Lane dedicated to exclusive or preferred use by bicycles that is phyisically separated from the vehicle-traffic lanes, e.g. by a verge.
#  * - values 22 to 30             reserved for future use. 
#  *
#  * @category: Road topology information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.1.1, named value 21 added in V2.2.1
