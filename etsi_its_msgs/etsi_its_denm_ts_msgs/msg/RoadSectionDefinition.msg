# /** 
#  * This DF provides the basic topological definition of a road section.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  * 
#  * @field startingPointSection: the position of the starting point of the section. 
#  * 
#  * @field lengthOfSection: the optional length of the section along the road profile (i.e. including curves).
#  * 
#  * @field endingPointSection: the optional position of the ending point of the section. 
#  * If this component is absent, the ending position is implicitly defined by other means, e.g. the starting point of the next RoadConfigurationSection, or the section�s length.
#  *
#  * @field connectedPaths: the identifier(s) of the path(s) having one or an ordered subset of waypoints located upstream of the RoadConfigurationSection� starting point. 
#  * 
#  * @field includedPaths: the identifier(s) of the path(s) that covers (either with all its length or with a part of it) a RoadConfigurationSection. 
#  *
#  * @field isEventZoneIncluded: indicates, if set to TRUE, that the @ref EventZone incl. its reference position covers a RoadConfigurationSection (either with all its length or with a part of it). 
#  * 
#  * @field isEventZoneConnected: indicates, if set to TRUE, that the @ref EventZone incl. its reference position has one or an ordered subset of waypoints located upstream of the RoadConfigurationSection� starting point.
#  *
#  * @category: Road topology information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.2.1
