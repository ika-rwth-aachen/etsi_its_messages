# /** 
#  * This DE represents a position along a single dimension such as the middle of a road or lane, measured as an offset from an externally defined starting point, 
#  * in direction of an externally defined reference direction.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n >= -8190` and `n < 0`) if the position is equal to or less than n x 1 metre and more than (n-1) x 1 metre, in opposite direction of the reference direction,
#  * - `0` if the position is at the starting point,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 8190`) if the position is equal to or less than n x 1 metre and more than (n-1) x 1 metre, in the same direction as the reference direction,
#  * - `8 190` if the position is out of range, i.e. equal to or greater than 8 189 m,
#  * - `8 191` if the position information is not available. 
#  *
