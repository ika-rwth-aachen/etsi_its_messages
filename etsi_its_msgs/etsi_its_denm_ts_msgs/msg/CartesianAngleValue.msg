# /** 
#  * This DE represents an angle value described in a local Cartesian coordinate system, per default counted positive in
#  * a right-hand local coordinate system from the abscissa.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to: 
#  * - `n` (`n >= 0` and `n < 3600`) if the angle is equal to or less than n x 0,1 degrees, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 degrees,
#  * - `3601` if the information is not available.
#  *
#  * The value 3600 shall not be used.
