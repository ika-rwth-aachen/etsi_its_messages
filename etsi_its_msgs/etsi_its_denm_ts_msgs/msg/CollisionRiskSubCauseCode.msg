#  * This DE represents the sub cause codes of the @ref CauseCode `collisionRisk`.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 - `unavailable`                    - in case information on the type of collision risk is unavailable,
#  * - 1 - `longitudinalCollisionRisk`      - in case the type of detected collision risk is longitudinal collision risk, 
#  *                                          e.g. forward collision or face to face collision,
#  * - 2 - `crossingCollisionRisk`          - in case the type of detected collision risk is crossing collision risk,
#  * - 3 - `lateralCollisionRisk`           - in case the type of detected collision risk is lateral collision risk,
#  * - 4 - `vulnerableRoadUser`             - in case the type of detected collision risk involves vulnerable road users
#  *                                          e.g. pedestrians or bicycles.
#  * - 5 - `collisionRiskWithPedestrian`    - in case the type of detected collision risk involves at least one pedestrian, 
#  * - 6 - `collisionRiskWithCyclist`       - in case the type of detected collision risk involves at least one cyclist (and no pedestrians),
#  * - 7 - `collisionRiskWithMotorVehicle`  - in case the type of detected collision risk involves at least one motor vehicle (and no pedestrians or cyclists),
#  * - 8-255                                - are reserved for future usage.
