#  * This DE represents the magnitude of the acceleration vector in a defined coordinate system.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `0` to indicate no acceleration,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 160`) to indicate acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `160` for acceleration values greater than 15,9 m/s^2,
#  * - `161` when the data is unavailable.

#  * @unit 0,1 m/s^2
