# /**
#  * This DE indicates the horizontal position confidence value which represents the estimated absolute position accuracy, in one of the axis direction as defined in a shape of ellipse with a 
#  * confidence level of 95 %. 
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 4 094`) if the accuracy is equal to or less than n * 0,01 metre,
#  * - `4 094` if the accuracy is out of range, i.e. greater than 4,093 m,
#  * - `4 095` if the accuracy information is unavailable.
#  *
#  * The value 0 shall not be used.
#  * 
#  * @note: The fact that a position coordinate value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(4095)`.
#  * can be caused by several reasons, such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the position coordinate value may be valid and used by the application.
#  * If a position coordinate value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(4094)`, it means that
#  * the position coordinate value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful
#  * for the application.
# 
#  * @unit 0,01 metre
