# /** 
#  * This type represents the Location Container.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field eventSpeed: optional speed of a detected dynamic event and the confidence of the speed information. 
#  *
#  * @field eventPositionHeading: the optional heading of a dynamic event and the confidence of the heading information.
#  *
#  * @field detectionZonesToEventPosition: the detection zone information approaching the event position, see clause 6.1.3.3.
#  *
#  * @field roadType: the optional road type information at the event position. 
#  *
#  * @field lanePositions: the optional lane(s) where the event is located, at the position indicated by the component eventPosition 
#  * of the Management container and for a given reference direction.
#  *
#  * @field occupiedLanes: the optional lane(s) that are fully or partially occupied by the event, at the position indicated by the 
#  * component eventPosition of the Management container and for a given reference direction.
#  *
#  * @field linkedIvims: the optional list of DF IvimReference, pointing to IVIMs that are semantically connected because providing information 
#  * applying to the road segment(s) covered by the components detectionZonesToEventPosition, detectionZonesToSpecifiedEventPoint and 
#  * the SituationContainer component eventZone.
#  *
#  * @field linkedMapem: the optional list of DF Mapreference, pointing to MAPEMs that are semantically connected because providing information 
#  * applying to the road segment(s) covered by the component detectionZonesToEventPosition, detectionZonesToSpecifiedEventPoint and 
#  * the SituationContainer component eventZone.
#  *
#  * @field detectionZonesToSpecifiedEventPoint: the optional detection zone information approaching towards a 
#  * specified event point, see clause 6.1.3.3. 
#  *
#  * @field predictedPaths: the optional list of future paths or trajectories that the event may move along or zones that the event may occupy.
