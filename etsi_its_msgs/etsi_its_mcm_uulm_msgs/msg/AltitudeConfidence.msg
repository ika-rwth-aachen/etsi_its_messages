# /**
#  * This DE indicates the altitude confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an altitude value of a geographical point with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  *   - 0  - `alt-000-01`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,01 metre,
#  *   - 1  - `alt-000-02`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,02 metre and greater than 0,01 metre,
#  *   - 2  - `alt-000-05`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,05 metre and greater than 0,02 metre,
#  *   - 3  - `alt-000-10`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,1 metre and greater than 0,05 metre,
#  *   - 4  - `alt-000-20`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,2 metre and greater than 0,1 metre,
#  *   - 5  - `alt-000-50`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,5 metre and greater than 0,2 metre,
#  *   - 6  - `alt-001-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 1 metre and greater than 0,5 metre,
#  *   - 7  - `alt-002-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 2 metres and greater than 1 metre,
#  *   - 8  - `alt-005-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 5 metres and greater than 2 metres,
#  *   - 9  - `alt-010-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 10 metres and greater than 5 metres,
#  *   - 10 - `alt-020-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 20 metres and greater than 10 metres,
#  *   - 11 - `alt-050-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 50 metres and greater than 20 metres,
#  *   - 12 - `alt-100-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 100 metres and greater than 50 metres,
#  *   - 13 - `alt-200-00`   - if the confidence value is equal to or less than 200 metres and greater than 100 metres,
#  *   - 14 - `outOfRange`   - if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 200 metres,
#  *   - 15 - `unavailable`  - if the confidence value is unavailable.
#  *
#  * @note: The fact that an altitude value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(15)` can be caused
#  * by several reasons, such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the altitude value may be valid and used by the application.
#  *
#  * @note: If an altitude value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(14)`, it means that the
#  * altitude value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful for the application.
#  *
#  * @category: GeoReference information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
