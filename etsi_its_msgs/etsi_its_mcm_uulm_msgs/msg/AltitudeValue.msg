# /**
#  * This DE represents the altitude value in a WGS84 coordinate system.
#  * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-100 000` if the altitude is equal to or less than -1 000 m,
#  * - `n` (`n > -100 000` and `n < 800 000`) if the altitude is equal to or less than n  x 0,01 metre and greater than (n-1) x 0,01 metre,
#  * - `800 000` if the altitude  greater than 7 999,99 m,
#  * - `800 001` if the information is not available.
#  *
#  * @note: the range of this DE does not use the full binary encoding range, but all reasonable values are covered. In order to cover all possible altitude ranges a larger encoding would be necessary.
#  * @unit: 0,01 metre
#  * @category: GeoReference information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1 (definition of 800 000 has slightly changed)
