#  /**
#  * This DE represents the vehicle acceleration at longitudinal direction in the centre of the mass of the empty vehicle.
#  * The value shall be provided in the vehicle coordinate system as defined in ISO 8855 [21], clause 2.11.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-160` for acceleration values equal to or less than -16 m/s^2,
#  * - `n` (`n > -160` and `n <= 0`) to indicate that the vehicle is braking with acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 160`) to indicate that the vehicle is accelerating with acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `160` for acceleration values greater than 15,9 m/s^2,
#  * - `161` when the data is unavailable. 
#  * 
#  * This acceleration is along the tangent plane of the road surface and does not include gravity components.
#  * @note: this DF is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use @ref AccelerationValue instead.
#  * 
#  * @note: The empty load vehicle is defined in ISO 1176 [8], clause 4.6.
#  * @unit: 0,1 m/s^2
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: description revised in V2.1.1 (the meaning of 160 has changed slightly). T
