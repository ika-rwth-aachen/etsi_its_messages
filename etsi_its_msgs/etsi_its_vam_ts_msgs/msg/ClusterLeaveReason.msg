#  * This DE indicates the reason why a cluster participant is leaving the cluster.

#  * - 1 - `clusterLeaderLost`            - if the cluster leader cannot be found anymore,   
#  * - 2 - `clusterDisbandedByLeader`     - if the cluster has been disbanded by the leader,
#  * - 3 - `outOfClusterBoundingBox`      - if the participants moved out of the cluster's bounding box,
#  * - 4 - `outOfClusterSpeedRange`       - if the cluster speed moved out of a defined range, 
#  * - 5 - `joiningAnotherCluster`        - if the participant is joining another cluster,
#  * - 6 - `cancelledJoin`                - if the participant is cancelling a joining procedure,
#  * - 7 - `failedJoin`                   - if the participant failed to join the cluster,
#  * - 8 - `safetyCondition`              - if a safety condition applies.
