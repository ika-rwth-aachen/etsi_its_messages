# /**
#  * This DE describes the status of the exterior light switches of a VRU.
#  *
#  * The value of each bit indicates the state of the switch, which commands the corresponding light. 
#  * The bit corresponding to a specific light shall be set to 1, when the corresponding switch is turned on, either manually by the driver or VRU 
#  * or automatically by a vehicle or VRU system: 
#  * - 0 `unavailable`     - indicates no information available, 
#  * - 1 `backFlashLight ` - indicates the status of the back flash light,
#  * - 2 `helmetLight`     - indicates the status of the helmet light,
#  * - 3 `armLight`        - indicates the status of the arm light,
#  * - 4 `legLight`        - indicates the status of the leg light,
#  * - 5 `wheelLight`      - indicates the status of the wheel light. 
#  * - Bits 6 to 8         - are reserved for future use. 
#  * The bit values do not indicate if the corresponding lamps are alight or not.
#  * If  VRU is not equipped with a certain light or if the light switch status information is not available, the corresponding bit shall be set to 0.
