#  * This DE indicates the estimated probability of a stability level and conversely also the probability of a stability loss.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `0` to indicate an estimated probability of a loss of stability of 0 %, i.e. "stable", 
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 50`) to indicate the actual stability level,
#  * - `50` to indicate a estimated probability of a loss of stability of 100 %, i.e. "total loss of stability",
#  * - the values between 51 and 62 are reserved for future use,
#  * - `63`: this value indicates that the information is unavailable.
#  *
#  * @unit: 2 %
