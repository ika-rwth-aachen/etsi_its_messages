# /**
#  *  This DE indicates the status of the possible human control over a VRU vehicle.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `unavailable`                 - to indicate that the information is unavailable,
#  * - 1 `braking`                     - to indicate that the VRU is braking,
#  * - 2 `hardBraking`                 - to indicate that the VRU is braking hard,
#  * - 3 `stopPedaling`                - to indicate that the VRU stopped pedaling,
#  * - 4 `brakingAndStopPedaling`      - to indicate that the VRU stopped pedaling an is braking,
#  * - 5 `hardBrakingAndStopPedaling`  - to indicate that the VRU stopped pedaling an is braking hard,
#  * - 6 `noReaction`                  - to indicate that the VRU is not changing its behavior.
#  * - 7 to 255                        - are reserved for future usage. Value 255 is set to "max" in order to bound the size of the encoded field.
