# /**
#  * This DE indicates the approximate size of a VRU including the VRU vehicle used.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `unavailable`    - to indicate that there is no matched size class or due to privacy reasons in profile 1, 
#  * - 1 `low`            - to indicate that the VRU size class is low depending on the VRU profile,
#  * - 2 `medium`         - to indicate that the VRU size class is medium depending on the VRU profile,
#  * - 3 `high`           - to indicate that the VRU size class is high depending on the VRU profile.
#  * - 4 to 15            - are reserved for future usage. Value 15 is set to "max" in order to bound the size of the encoded field.
