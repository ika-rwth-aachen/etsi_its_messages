#  * This DE represents the longitudinal offset of a map-matched position along a matched lane, beginning from the lane's starting point.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n >= 0` and `n < 32766`) if the longitudinal offset information is equal to or less than n x 0,1 metre and more than (n-1) x 0,1 metre,
#  * - `32 766` if the longitudinal offset is out of range, i.e. greater than 3276,5 m,
#  * - `32 767` if the longitudinal offset information is not available.
