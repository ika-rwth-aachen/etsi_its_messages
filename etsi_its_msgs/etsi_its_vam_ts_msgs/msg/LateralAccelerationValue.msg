# /**
#  * This DE represents the vehicle acceleration at lateral direction in the centre of the mass of the empty vehicle.
#  * It corresponds to the vehicle coordinate system as specified in ISO 8855 [21].
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-160` for acceleration values equal to or less than -16 m/s^2,
#  * - `n` (`n > -160` and `n <= 0`) to indicate that the vehicle is accelerating towards the right side with regards to the vehicle orientation 
#  *                            with acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2 and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 160`) to indicate that the vehicle is accelerating towards the left hand side with regards to the vehicle orientation 
# 						     with acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2 and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `160` for acceleration values greater than 15,9 m/s^2,
#  * - `161` when the data is unavailable.
#  *
#  * @note: the empty load vehicle is defined in ISO 1176 [8], clause 4.6.
#  * @note: this DF is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use @ref AccelerationValue instead.
#  *  
#  * @unit: 0,1 m/s^2
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Description updated in V2.1.1 (the meaning of 160 has changed slightly).
