#  * @field region: the optional identifier of the entity that is responsible for the region in which the intersection is placed.
#  * It is the duty of that entity to guarantee that the @ref Id is unique within the region.
#  *
#  * @field id: the identifier of the intersection
#  *
#  * @note: when the component region is present, the IntersectionReferenceId is guaranteed to be globally unique.
