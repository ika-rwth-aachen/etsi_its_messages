#  /**
#  * @details VruMotionPredictionContainer
#  * The VRU Motion Prediction container of the VAM carries the past and future motion state information of the VRU.
#  * It includes the following components (setting indications are specified in clause 7.3.6 of TS 103 300-3). 
#  * At least one of the fields below shall be present if the container is present in the VAM: 
#  *
#  * @field pathHistory: represents the VRU's recent movement over some past time and/or distance. 
#  *        It consists of a list of path points. 
#  * @field pathPrediction: provides the set of predicted locations of the ITS-S, confidence values 
#  *        and the corresponding future time instants. 
#  * @field safeDistance: provides indication of safe distance between an ego-VRU and up to 8 other ITS-S 
#  *        or entity on the road to indicate whether the ego-VRU is at a safe distance (that is less likely to 
#  *        physically collide) from another ITS-S or entity on the road. 
#  * @field trajectoryInterceptionIndication: provides the indication for possible trajectory interception 
#  *        with up to 8 VRUs or other objects on the road.. 
#  * @field accelerationChangeIndication: provides an acceleration change indication of the VRU. 
#  *        When present this DF indicates an anticipated change in the VRU speed for period of actionDeltaTime.
#  * @field headingChangeIndication: provides additional data elements associated to heading change indicators 
#  *        such as a change of travel direction (left or right). 
#  *        The direction change action is performed for a period of actionDeltaTime. 
#  * @field stabilityChangeIndication: provides an estimation of the VRU stability. 
#  * 
#  * @category: GeoReference information, VRU information
#  * @revision: V2.2.1
