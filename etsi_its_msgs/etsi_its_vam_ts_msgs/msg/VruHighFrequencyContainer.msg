# * @details VruHighFrequencyContainer
# * The VRU HF container of the VAM contains potentially fast-changing status information of the VRU ITS-S.
# * It includes the following components (setting indications are specified in clause 7.3.3 of TS 103 300-3): 
# * 
# * @field heading: heading and heading confidence of the originating VRU with regards to the true north. 
# * @field speed: speed in moving direction and speed confidence of the originating VRU.   
# * @field longitudinalAcceleration: longitudinal acceleration of the originating VRU. 
# * @field curvature: related to the actual trajectory of the originating VRU vehicle.
#          _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
# * @field curvatureCalculationMode: indicates whether vehicle yaw-rate is used in the calculation of
# *        the curvature of the VRU vehicle ITS-S that originates the VAM. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
# * @field yawRate: yaw rate of originating VRU vehicle. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
# * @field lateralAcceleration: originating VRU lateral acceleration in the street plane.
# *        This field shall be present if the data is available at the originating ITS-S. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_ 
# * @field verticalAcceleration: vertical acceleration of the originating VRU.
# *        This field shall be present if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
# * @field vruLanePosition: lane position of the referencePosition of a VRU, which is either a VRU-specific non-traffic lane  
# *        or a standard traffic lane. This field shall be present if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
# * @field environment: provides contextual awareness of the VRU among other road users.
# *        This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
# * @field movementControl: indicates the mechanism used by the VRU to control the  longitudinal movement of the VRU vehicle.
# *        This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
# * @field orientation : complements the dimensions of the VRU vehicle by defining the angle of the VRU vehicle longitudinal
# *        axis with regards to the WGS84 north. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
# * @field rollAngle: provides the angle and angle accuracy between the ground plane and the current orientation of a vehicle's
# *        y-axis with respect to the ground plane about the x-axis according to the ISO 8855. 
# *        This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
# * @field deviceUsage: provides indications from the personal device about the potential 
# *        activity of the VRU. This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
# *        _(recommended for VRU Profile 1)_
# * 
# * @category: VRU information
# * @revision: V2.2.1
