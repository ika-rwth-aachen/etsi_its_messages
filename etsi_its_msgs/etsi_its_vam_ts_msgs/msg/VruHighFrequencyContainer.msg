# /**
#  * @details VruHighFrequencyContainer
#  * The VRU HF container of the VAM contains potentially fast-changing status information of the VRU ITS-S.
#  * It includes the following components (setting indications are specified in clause 7.3.3 of TS 103 300-3): 
#  * 
#  * @field heading: heading and heading confidence of the originating VRU with regards to the true north. 
#  * @field speed: speed in moving direction and speed confidence of the originating VRU.   
#  * @field longitudinalAcceleration: longitudinal acceleration of the originating VRU. 
#  * @field curvature: related to the actual trajectory of the originating VRU vehicle.
#           _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
#  * @field curvatureCalculationMode: indicates whether vehicle yaw-rate is used in the calculation of
#  *        the curvature of the VRU vehicle ITS-S that originates the VAM. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
#  * @field yawRate: yaw rate of originating VRU vehicle. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
#  * @field lateralAcceleration: originating VRU lateral acceleration in the street plane.
#  *        This field shall be present if the data is available at the originating ITS-S. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_ 
#  * @field verticalAcceleration: vertical acceleration of the originating VRU.
#  *        This field shall be present if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
#  * @field vruLanePosition: lane position of the referencePosition of a VRU, which is either a VRU-specific non-traffic lane  
#  *        or a standard traffic lane. This field shall be present if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
#  * @field environment: provides contextual awareness of the VRU among other road users.
#  *        This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
#  * @field movementControl: indicates the mechanism used by the VRU to control the  longitudinal movement of the VRU vehicle.
#  *        This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
#  * @field orientation : complements the dimensions of the VRU vehicle by defining the angle of the VRU vehicle longitudinal
#  *        axis with regards to the WGS84 north. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
#  * @field rollAngle: provides the angle and angle accuracy between the ground plane and the current orientation of a vehicle's
#  *        y-axis with respect to the ground plane about the x-axis according to the ISO 8855. 
#  *        This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S. _(recommended for VRU Profile 2)_
#  * @field deviceUsage: provides indications from the personal device about the potential 
#  *        activity of the VRU. This field shall be present only if the data is available at the originating ITS-S.
#  *        _(recommended for VRU Profile 1)_
#  * 
#  * @category: VRU information
#  * @revision: V2.2.1
