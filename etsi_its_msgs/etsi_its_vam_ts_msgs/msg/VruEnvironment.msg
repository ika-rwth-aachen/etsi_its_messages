#  * - The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0 `unavailable`            - to indicate that the information on the type of environment is unavailable,
#  * - 1 `intersectionCrossing`   - to indicate that the VRU is on an intersection or crossing,
#  * - 2 `zebraCrossing`          - to indicate that the VRU is on a  zebra crossing (crosswalk),
#  * - 3 `sidewalk`               - to indicate that the VRU is on a sidewalk,
#  * - 4 `onVehicleRoad`          - to indicate that the VRU is on a traffic lane,
#  * - 5 `protectedGeographicArea`- to indicate that the VRU is in a protected area.
#  * - value 5 to 255             - are reserved for future usage. Value 255 is set to "max" in order to bound the size of the encoded field.
