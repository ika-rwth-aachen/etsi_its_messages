# /**
#  * This DF indicates the horizontal position confidence ellipse which represents the estimated accuracy with a 
#  * confidence level of 95 %. The centre of the ellipse shape corresponds to the reference
#  * position point for which the position accuracy is evaluated.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field semiMajorAxisLength: half of length of the major axis, i.e. distance between the centre point
#  * and major axis point of the position accuracy ellipse. 
#  *
#  * @field semiMinorAxisLength: half of length of the minor axis, i.e. distance between the centre point
#  * and minor axis point of the position accuracy ellipse. 
#  *
#  * @field semiMajorAxisOrientation: orientation direction of the ellipse major axis of the position accuracy
#  * ellipse with regards to the WGS84 north. 
#  * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * @category GeoReference information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1 based on @ref PosConfidenceEllipse
