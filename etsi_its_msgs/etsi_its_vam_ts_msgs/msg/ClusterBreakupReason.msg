#  * - 3 - `joiningAnotherCluster`                - if the cluster leader is about to join another cluster,
#  * - 4 - `enteringLowRiskAreaBasedOnMaps`       - if the cluster is entering an area idenrified as low risk based on the use of maps,
#  * - 5 - `receptionOfCpmContainingCluster`      - if the leader received a Collective Perception Message containing information about the same cluster.
