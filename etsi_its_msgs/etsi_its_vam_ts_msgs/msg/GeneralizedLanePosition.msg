#  *
#  * The following options are available:
#  *
#  * @field trafficLanePosition: a position on a traffic lane. 
#  * 
#  * @field nonTrafficLanePosition: a position on a lane which is not a traffic lane.
#  * 
#  * @field trafficIslandPosition: a position on a traffic island
#  * 
#  * @field mapPosition: a position on a lane identified in a MAPEM.
