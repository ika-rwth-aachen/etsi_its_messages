# /**
#  * This DF provides the safe distance indication of a traffic participant with other traffic participant(s).
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  * 
#  * @field subjectStation: optionally indicates one "other" traffic participant identified by its ITS-S.
#  *  
#  * @field safeDistanceIndicator: indicates whether the distance between the ego ITS-S and the traffic participant(s) is safe.
#  * If subjectStation is present then it indicates whether the distance between the ego ITS-S and the traffic participant indicated in the component subjectStation is safe. 
#  *
#  * @field timeToCollision: optionally indicated the time-to-collision calculated as sqrt(LaDi^2 + LoDi^2 + VDi^2/relative speed 
#  * and represented in  the  nearest 100  ms. This component may be present only if subjectStation is present. 
#  *
#  * @note: the abbreviations used are Lateral Distance (LaD),  Longitudinal Distance (LoD) and Vertical Distance (VD) 
#  * and their respective  thresholds, Minimum  Safe  Lateral  Distance (MSLaD), Minimum  Safe  Longitudinal Distance  (MSLoD),  and  Minimum  Safe Vertical Distance (MSVD).
#  *
#  * @category: Traffic information, Kinematic information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1
