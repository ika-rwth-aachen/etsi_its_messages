#  * The VRU LF container of the VAM contains potentially slow-changing information of the VRU ITS-S.
#  * It is mandatory with higher periodicity as specified in clause 6.2 or when VRU cluster operation container is present.
#  * It includes the following components (setting indications are specified in clause 7.3.4 of TS 103 300-3): 
#  *
#  * @field profileAndSubprofile: profile of the ITS-S that originates the VAM, including sub-profile information. 
#  * @field sizeClass: information about the size of the VRU. 
#  * @field exteriorLights: status of the most important exterior lights switches of the VRU ITS-S that originates the VAM. 
#  *        _(conditional mandatory as specified in clause 7.3.4 of TS 103 300-3)_
