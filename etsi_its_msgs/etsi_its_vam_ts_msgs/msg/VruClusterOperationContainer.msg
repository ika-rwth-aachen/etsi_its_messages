#  /**
#  * @details VruClusterOperationContainer
#  * The VRU Cluster Operation container of the VAM provides information relevant to change of cluster state and composition.
#  * It is mandatory if the VAM is transmitted by a VRU joining, leaving or breaking up a cluster.
#  * It includes the following components (setting indications are specified in clause 7.3.5 of TS 103 300-3). 
#  * At least one of the fields below shall be present if the container is present in the VAM: 
#  *
#  * @field clusterJoinInfo: indicates the intent of an individual VAM transmitter to join a cluster. 
#  * @field clusterLeaveInfo : indicates that an individual VAM transmitter has recently left the VRU cluster. 
#  * @field clusterBreakupInfo: indicates the intent of a cluster VAM transmitter to stop sending cluster VAMs. 
#  * @field clusterIdChangeTimeInfo: indicates the intent of a cluster VAM transmitter to change cluster ID. 
#  * 
#  * @category: VRU information
#  * @revision: V2.2.1
