# *
# * This DE represents a difference in time with respect to a reference time.
# *
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 10001`) to indicate a time value equal to or less than n x 0,001 s, and greater than (n-1) x 0,001 s,
# *
# * Example: a time interval between two consecutive message transmissions.
# * 
# * @unit: 0,001 s
# * @category: Basic information
# * @revision: Created in V2.1.1 from the DE TransmissionInterval in [2]
