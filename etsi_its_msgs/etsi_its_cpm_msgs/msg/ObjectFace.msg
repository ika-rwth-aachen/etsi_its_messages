# * This DE indicates the face or part of a face of a solid object.
# *
# * The object is modelled  as a rectangular prism that has a length that is greater than its width, with the faces of the object being defined as:
# * - front: the face defined by the prism's width and height, and which is the first face in direction of longitudinal movement of the object,
# * - back: the face defined by the prism's width and height, and which is the last face in direction of longitudinal movement of the object,
# * - side: the faces defined by the prism's length and height with "left" and "right" defined by looking at the front face and "front" and "back" defined w.r.t to the front and back faces. 
# *
# * Note: It is permissible to derive the required object dimensions and orientation from models to provide a best guess.
