# * The DE indicates if a vehicle is carrying goods in the special transport conditions.
# *
# * The corresponding bit shall be set to 1 under the following conditions:
# * - 0 `heavyLoad`        - the vehicle is carrying goods with heavy load,
# * - 1 `excessWidth`      - the vehicle is carrying goods in excess of width,
# * - 2 `excessLength`     - the vehicle is carrying goods in excess of length,
# * - 3 `excessHeight`     - the vehicle is carrying goods in excess of height.
# *
# * Otherwise, the corresponding bit shall be set to 0.
