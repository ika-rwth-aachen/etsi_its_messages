# *
# * This DE represents the steering wheel angle of the vehicle at certain point in time.
# * The value shall be provided in the vehicle coordinate system as defined in ISO 8855 [21], clause 2.11.
# * 
# * The value shall be set to:
# * - `-511` if the steering wheel angle is equal to or greater than 511 x 1,5 degrees = 766,5 degrees to the right,
# * - `n` (`n > -511` and `n <= 0`) if  the steering wheel angle is equal to or less than n x 1,5 degrees, and greater than (n-1) x 1,5 degrees, 
#      turning clockwise (i.e. to the right),
# * - `n` (`n >= 1` and `n < 511`) if the steering wheel angle is equal to or less than n x 0,1 degrees, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 degrees, 
#      turning counter-clockwise (i.e. to the left),
# * - `511` if the steering wheel angle is greater than 510 x 1,5 degrees = 765 degrees to the left,
# * - `512` if information is not available.
# *
# * @unit: 1,5 degree
# * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1 (meaning of value 511 has changed slightly).
