# * This DF describes a radial shape. The triangular or cone-shaped volume is
# * constructed by sweeping the provided range about the reference point  between a horizontal start 
# * and a horizontal end angle in positive angular direction of the WGS84
# * coordinate system. A vertical opening angle may be provided in a Cartesian coordinate system with
# * the x-axis located in the North-East plane of the WGS84 coordinate system. The sensor height may
# * be provided to reflect characteristics of sensors mounted at an altitude (e.g. sensors mounted
# * above intersections).
# *
# * It shall include the following components:
# * 
# * @field shapeReferencePoint: the optional reference point used for the definition of the shape, relative to an externally specified reference position. 
# * If this component is absent, the externally specified reference position represents the shape's  reference point. 
# *
# * @field range: the radial range of the shape from the shape's reference point. 
# *
# * @field stationaryHorizontalOpeningAngleStart:  the orientation indicating the beginning of the 
# * shape's horizontal opening angle in positive angular direction with respect to the 
# * WGS84 coordinate system.
# *
# * @field stationaryHorizontalOpeningAngleEnd: The orientation indicating the end of the shape's 
# * horizontal opening angle in positive angular direction with respect to the WGS84 coordinate system.
# *
# * @field verticalOpeningAngleStart: optional orientation indicating the beginning of the shape's
# * opening angle in positive angular direction of a Cartesian coordinate system with its x-axis 
# * located in the north-east plane of the WGS84 coordinate system.
# *
# * @field verticalOpeningAngleEnd: optional orientation indicating the end of the shape's 
# * vertical opening angle in positive angular direction of a Cartesian coordinate system with its x-axis 
# * located in the north-east plane of the WGS84 coordinate system.
