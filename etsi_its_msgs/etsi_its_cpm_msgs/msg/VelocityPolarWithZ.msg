# * This DF represents a velocity vector in a polar or cylindrical coordinate system.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# * 
# * @field velocityMagnitude: magnitude of the velocity vector on the reference plane, with the associated confidence value.
# * 
# * @field velocityDirection: polar angle of the velocity vector on the reference plane, with the associated confidence value.
# *
# * @field zVelocity: the optional z component of the velocity vector along the reference axis of the cylindrical coordinate system, with the associated confidence value.
# * 
# * @category: Kinematic information
# * @revision: Created in V2.1.1
