# * This DF indicates the horizontal position confidence ellipse which represents the estimated accuracy with a 
# * confidence level of 95 %. The centre of the ellipse shape corresponds to the reference
# * position point for which the position accuracy is evaluated.
# *
# * It shall include the following components: 
# *
# * @field semiMajorAxisLength: half of length of the major axis, i.e. distance between the centre point
# * and major axis point of the position accuracy ellipse. 
# *
# * @field semiMinorAxisLength: half of length of the minor axis, i.e. distance between the centre point
# * and minor axis point of the position accuracy ellipse. 
# *
# * @field semiMajorAxisOrientation: orientation direction of the ellipse major axis of the position accuracy
# * ellipse with regards to the WGS84 north. 
# * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
