# /**
#  * This DF indicates a position on a topology description transmitted in a MAPEM according to ETSI TS 103 301 [15].
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  * 
#  * @field mapReference: optionally identifies the MAPEM containing the topology information.
#  * It is absent if the MAPEM topology is known from the context.
#  * 
#  * @field laneId: optionally identifies the lane in the road segment or intersection topology on which the position is located.
#  *
#  * @field connectionId: optionally identifies the connection inside the conflict area of an intersection, i.e. it identifies a trajectory for travelling through the
#  * conflict area of an intersection which connects e.g an ingress with an egress lane.
#  *
#  * @field longitudinalLanePosition: optionally indicates the longitudinal offset of the map-matched position of the object along the lane or connection.
#  * 
#  * @category: Road topology information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.1.1
