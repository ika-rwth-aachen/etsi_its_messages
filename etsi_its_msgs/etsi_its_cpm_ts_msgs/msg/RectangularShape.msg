# /** 
#  * This DF represents the shape of a rectangular area or a right rectangular prism that is centred on a reference position defined outside of the context of this DF. 
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  * 
#  * @field centerPoint: represents an optional offset point which the rectangle is centred on with respect to the reference position.
#  *
#  * @field semiLength: represents half the length of the rectangle.
#  * 
#  * @field semiBreadth: represents half the breadth of the rectangle.
#  *
#  * @field orientation: represents the optional orientation of the lenght of the rectangle in the WGS84 coordinate system.
#  * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * @field height: represents the optional height, present if the shape is a right rectangular prism with height extending in the positive z-axis.
#  *
#  * @category GeoReference information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1
