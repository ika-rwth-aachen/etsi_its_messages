# /**
#  * This DE represents a speed value, i.e. the magnitude of the velocity-vector. 
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `0` in a standstill situation.
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 16 382`) if the applicable value is equal to or less than n x 0,01 m/s, and greater than (n-1) x 0,01 m/s,
#  * - `16 382` for speed values greater than 163,81 m/s,
#  * - `16 383` if the speed accuracy information is not available.
#  * 
#  * @note: the definition of standstill is out of scope of the present document.
#  *
#  * @unit: 0,01 m/s
#  * @category: Kinematic information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1 (the meaning of 16382 has changed slightly)
