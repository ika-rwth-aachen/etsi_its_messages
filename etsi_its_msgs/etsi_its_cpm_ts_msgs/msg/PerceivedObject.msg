# --- ASN.1 Definition ---------------------------------------------------------
# /** 
#  * This DF contains information about a perceived object including its kinematic state and attitude vector in a pre-defined coordinate system and with respect to a reference time.
#  * 
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field objectId: optional identifier assigned to a detected object.
#  *
#  * @field measurementDeltaTime: the time difference from a reference time to the time of the  measurement of the object. 
#  * Negative values indicate that the provided object state refers to a point in time before the reference time.
#  *
#  * @field position: the position of the geometric centre of the object's bounding box within the pre-defined coordinate system.
#  *
#  * @field velocity: the velocity vector of the object within the pre-defined coordinate system.
#  *
#  * @field acceleration: the acceleration vector of the object within the pre-defined coordinate system.
#  *
#  * @field angles: optional Euler angles of the object bounding box at the time of measurement. 
#  * 
#  * @field zAngularVelocity: optional angular velocity of the object around the z-axis at the time of measurement.
#  * The angular velocity is measured with positive values considering the object orientation turning around the z-axis using the right-hand rule.
#  *
#  * @field lowerTriangularCorrelationMatrices: optional set of lower triangular correlation matrices for selected components of the provided kinematic state and attitude vector.
#  *
#  * @field objectDimensionZ: optional z-dimension of object bounding box. 
#  * This dimension shall be measured along the direction of the z-axis after all the rotations have been applied. 
#  *
#  * @field objectDimensionY: optional y-dimension of the object bounding box. 
#  * This dimension shall be measured along the direction of the y-axis after all the rotations have been applied. 
#  *
#  * @field objectDimensionX: optional x-dimension of object bounding box.
#  * This dimension shall be measured along the direction of the x-axis after all the rotations have been applied.
#  * 
#  * @field objectAge: optional age of the detected and described object, i.e. the difference in time between the moment 
#  * it has been first detected and the reference time of the message. Value `1500` indicates that the object has been observed for more than 1.5s.
#  *
#  * @field objectPerceptionQuality: optional confidence associated to the object. 
#  *
#  * @field sensorIdList: optional list of sensor-IDs which provided the measurement data. 
#  *
#  * @field classification: optional classification of the described object
#  *
#  * @field matchedPosition: optional map-matched position of an object.
#  *
#  * @category Sensing information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1
