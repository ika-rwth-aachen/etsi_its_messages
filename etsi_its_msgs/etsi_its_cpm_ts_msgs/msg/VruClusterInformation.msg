#  * It shall include the following components:

#  * @field clusterId: optional identifier of a VRU cluster .
#  *
#  * @field clusterBoundingBoxShape: optionally indicates the shape of the cluster bounding box.
#  *
#  * @field clusterCardinalitySize: indicates an estimation of the number of VRUs in the group, i.e. the known members in the cluster + 1 (for the cluster leader) .
#  *
#  * @field clusterProfiles: optionally identifies all the VRU profile types that are known to be within the cluster.
#  * if this component is absent it means that the information is unavailable.
