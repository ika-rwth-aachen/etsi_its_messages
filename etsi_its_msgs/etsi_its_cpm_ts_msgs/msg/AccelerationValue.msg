# /** 
#  * This DE represents the value of an acceleration component in a defined coordinate system.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `-160` for acceleration values equal to or less than -16 m/s^2,
#  * - `n` (`n > -160` and `n <= 0`) to indicate negative acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 160`) to indicate positive acceleration equal to or less than n x 0,1 m/s^2, and greater than (n-1) x 0,1 m/s^2,
#  * - `160` for acceleration values greater than 15,9 m/s^2,
#  * - `161` when the data is unavailable.
#  *
#  * @note: the formula for values > -160 and <160 results in rounding up to the next value. Zero acceleration is indicated using n=0.
#  * @unit 0,1 m/s^2
#  * @category: Kinematic information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.1.1
