#  * @field shapeReferencePoint: the optional reference point used for the definition of the shape, relative to an externally specified reference position. 
#  * If this component is absent, the externally specified reference position represents the shape's reference point. 
#  *
#  * @field polygon: the polygonal area represented by a list of minimum `3` to maximum `16` @ref CartesianPosition3d.
#  * All nodes of the polygon shall be considered relative to the shape's reference point.
#  *
#  * @field height: the optional height, present if the shape is a right prism extending in the positive z-axis.
