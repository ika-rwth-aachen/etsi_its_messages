# /** 
#  * This DE Identifies all the VRU profile types within a cluster.
#  * It consist of a Bitmap encoding VRU profiles, to allow multiple profiles to be indicated in a single cluster (heterogeneous cluster if more than one profile).
#  * 
#  * The corresponding bit shall be set to 1 under the following conditions:
#  * - 0 `pedestrian`  - indicates that the VRU cluster contains at least one pedestrian VRU,
#  * - 1 `bicycle`     - indicates that the VRU cluster contains at least one bicycle VRU member,
#  * - 2 `motorcyclist`- indicates that the VRU cluster contains at least one motorcycle VRU member,
#  * - 3 `animal`      - indicates that the VRU cluster contains at least one animal VRU member.
#  * 
#  * Otherwise, the corresponding bit shall be set to 0.
