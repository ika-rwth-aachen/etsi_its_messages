# /** 
#  * This DF provides detailed information about an attached trailer.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field refPointId: identifier of the reference point of the trailer.
#  *
#  * @field hitchPointOffset: optional position of the hitch point in negative x-direction (according to ISO 8855) from the
#  * vehicle Reference Point.
#  *
#  * @field frontOverhang: optional length of the trailer overhang in the positive x direction (according to ISO 8855) from the
#  * trailer Reference Point indicated by the refPointID. The value defaults to 0 in case the trailer
#  * is not overhanging to the front with respect to the trailer reference point.
#  *
#  * @field rearOverhang: optional length of the trailer overhang in the negative x direction (according to ISO 8855) from the
#  * trailer Reference Point indicated by the refPointID.
#  *
#  * @field trailerWidth: optional width of the trailer.
#  *
#  * @field hitchAngle: optional Value and confidence value of the angle between the trailer orientation (corresponding to the x
#  * direction of the ISO 8855 [21] coordinate system centered on the trailer) and the direction of
#  * the segment having as end points the reference point of the trailer and the reference point of
#  * the pulling vehicle, which can be another trailer or a vehicle looking on the horizontal plane
#  * xy, described in the local Cartesian coordinate system of the trailer. The
#  * angle is measured with negative values considering the trailer orientation turning clockwise
#  * starting from the segment direction. The angle value accuracy is provided with the
#  * confidence level of 95 %.
#  *
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.1.1
