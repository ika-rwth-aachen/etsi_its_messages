# /** 
#  * This DF represents a lower triangular positive semi-definite matrix. 
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field componentsIncludedIntheMatrix: the indication of which components of a @ref PerceivedObject are included in the matrix. 
#  * This component also implicitly indicates the number n of included components which defines the size (n x n) of the full correlation matrix "A".
#  *
#  * @field matrix: the list of cells of the lower triangular positive semi-definite matrix ordered by columns and by rows. 
#  *
#  * The number of columns to be included "k" is equal to the number of included components "n" indicated by componentsIncludedIntheMatrix minus 1: k = n-1.
#  * These components shall be included in the order or their appearance in componentsIncludedIntheMatrix.
#  * Each column "i" of the lowerTriangularCorrelationMatrixColumns contains k-(i-1) values.
#  *
#  * @category: Sensing information
