# /**
#  * This DF represents the actual perception capabilities available to the transmitting ITS-S, offering additional (often dynamic) details to the information provided in the sensor information container.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
# 
#  * @field measurementDeltaTime: difference between the time of estimation of the perception region and the reference time. Positive values indicates that the provided information refers to a point in time after the reference time.
#  *
#  * @field perceptionRegionConfidence: the perception confidence.
#  *
#  * @field perceptionRegionShape: specification of the shape of the perception region.
#  *
#  * @field shadowingApplies: indicates if the standard shadowing approach applies to the described perception region.
#  *
#  * @field sensorIdList: the optional list of identifiers of the sensors which are involved in perceiving the region.
#  *
#  * @field numberOfPerceivedObjects: the optional number of perceived objects contained in the perception region specified in the component perceptionRegionShape. 
#  *
#  * @field perceivedObjectIds: the optional list of identifiers of the objects specified in the Perceived Object Container that are contained in the perception region specified in the component perceptionRegionShape.
