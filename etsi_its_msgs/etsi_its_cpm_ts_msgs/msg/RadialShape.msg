# /**
#  * This DF describes a radial shape. The triangular or cone-shaped volume is
#  * constructed by sweeping the provided range about the reference point  between a horizontal start 
#  * and a horizontal end angle in positive angular direction of the WGS84
#  * coordinate system. A vertical opening angle may be provided in a Cartesian coordinate system with
#  * the x-axis located in the North-East plane of the WGS84 coordinate system. The sensor height may
#  * be provided to reflect characteristics of sensors mounted at an altitude (e.g. sensors mounted
#  * above intersections).
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components:
#  * 
#  * @field shapeReferencePoint: the optional reference point used for the definition of the shape, relative to an externally specified reference position. 
#  * If this component is absent, the externally specified reference position represents the shape's  reference point. 
#  *
#  * @field range: the radial range of the shape from the shape's reference point. 
#  *
#  * @field stationaryHorizontalOpeningAngleStart:  the orientation indicating the beginning of the 
#  * shape's horizontal opening angle in positive angular direction with respect to the 
#  * WGS84 coordinate system.
#  *
#  * @field stationaryHorizontalOpeningAngleEnd: The orientation indicating the end of the shape's 
#  * horizontal opening angle in positive angular direction with respect to the WGS84 coordinate system.
#  *
#  * @field verticalOpeningAngleStart: optional orientation indicating the beginning of the shape's
#  * opening angle in positive angular direction of a Cartesian coordinate system with its x-axis 
#  * located in the north-east plane of the WGS84 coordinate system.
#  *
#  * @field verticalOpeningAngleEnd: optional orientation indicating the end of the shape's 
#  * vertical opening angle in positive angular direction of a Cartesian coordinate system with its x-axis 
#  * located in the north-east plane of the WGS84 coordinate system. 
#  *
#  * @category GeoReference information
