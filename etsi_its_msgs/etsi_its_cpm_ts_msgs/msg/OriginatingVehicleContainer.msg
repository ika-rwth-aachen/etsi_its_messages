#  *
#  * @field pitchAngle: the optional angle and angle accuracy between the ground plane and the current orientation of the vehicle's x-axis with respect to the ground plane about the y-axis according to the ISO 8855.
#  *
#  * @field rollAngle: the optional angle and angle accuracy between the ground plane and the current orientation of a vehicle's y-axis with respect to the ground plane about the x-axis according to the ISO 8855
#  *
#  * @field trailerData: information about the trailer dimensions and orientation in case a trailer is present.
