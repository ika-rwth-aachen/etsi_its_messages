# /** 
#  * This DE indicates the angle confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of an angle value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * The value shall be set to: 
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 126`)  if the accuracy is equal to or less than n * 0,1 degrees and greater than (n-1) x * 0,1 degrees,
#  * - `126` if the  accuracy is out of range, i.e. greater than 12,5 degrees,
#  * - `127` if the accuracy information is not available.
#  *
#  * @unit: 0,1 degrees
#  * @category: Basic information
#  * @revision: Created in V2.1.1
