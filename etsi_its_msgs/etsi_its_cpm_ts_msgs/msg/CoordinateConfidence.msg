# * This DE indicates the coordinate confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of a position coordinate with a default confidence level of 95 %.
# * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
# *
# * The value shall be set to: 
# * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 4095`) if the confidence value is is equal to or less than n x 0,01 metre, and greater than (n-1) x 0,01 metre,
# * - `4095` if the confidence value is greater than 40,94 metres,
# * - `4096` if the confidence value is not available.
