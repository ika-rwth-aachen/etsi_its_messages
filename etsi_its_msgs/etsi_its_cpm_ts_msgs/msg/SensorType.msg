# /** 
#  * This DE indicates the type of sensor.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - 0  `undefined`         - in case the sensor type is undefined. 
#  * - 1  `radar`             - in case the sensor is a radar,
#  * - 2  `lidar`             - in case the sensor is a lidar,
#  * - 3  `monovideo`         - in case the sensor is mono video,
#  * - 4  `stereovision`      - in case the sensor is stereo vision,
#  * - 5  `nightvision`       - in case the sensor is night vision,
#  * - 6  `ultrasonic`        - in case the sensor is ultrasonic,
#  * - 7  `pmd`               - in case the sensor is photonic mixing device,
#  * - 8  `inductionLoop`     - in case the sensor is an induction loop,
#  * - 9  `sphericalCamera`   - in case the sensor is a spherical camera,
#  * - 10 `uwb`               - in case the sensor is ultra wide band,
#  * - 11 `acoustic`          - in case the sensor is acoustic,
#  * - 12 `localAggregation`  - in case the information is provided by a system that aggregates information from different local sensors. Aggregation may include fusion,
#  * - 13 `itsAggregation`    - in case the information is provided by a system that aggregates information from other received ITS messages.
#  * - 14-31                  - are reserved for future usage.
