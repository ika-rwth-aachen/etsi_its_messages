# /**
#  * This DE indicates the speed confidence value which represents the estimated absolute accuracy of a speed value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
#  * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  * 
#  * The value shall be set to:
#  * - `n` (`n > 0` and `n < 126`) if the confidence value is equal to or less than n * 0,01 m/s.
#  * - `126` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 1,25 m/s,
#  * - `127` if the confidence value information is not available.
#  *  
#  * @note: The fact that a speed value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(127)` can be caused by several reasons, such as:
#  * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
#  * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
#  * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
#  * In all 3 cases above, the speed value may be valid and used by the application.
#  * 
#  * @note: If a speed value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(126)`, it means that the speed value is not valid 
#  * and therefore cannot be trusted. Such is not useful for the application.
#  *
#  * @unit: 0,01 m/s
#  * @category: Vehicle information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
