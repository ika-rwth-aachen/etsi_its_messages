# /**
#  * This DF provides the altitude and confidence level of an altitude information in a WGS84 coordinate system.
#  * The specific WGS84 coordinate system is specified by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  *
#  * @field altitudeValue: altitude of a geographical point.
#  *
#  * @field altitudeConfidence: confidence level of the altitudeValue.
#  *
#  * @note: this DF is kept for backwards compatibility reasons only. It is recommended to use the @ref AltitudeWithConfidence instead. 
#  * @category: GeoReference information
#  * @revision: Description revised in V2.1.1
