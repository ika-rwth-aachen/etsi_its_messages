#  * 
#  * @field xCoordinate: the x-coordinate of the offset point.
#  *
#  * @field yCoordinate: the y-coordinate of the offset point.
#  *
#  * @field zCoordinate: the optional z-coordinate of the offset point.
#  *
#  * @field radialShapesList: the list of radial shape details.
#  *
#  * @category: Georeference information
#  * @revision: created in V2.1.1
