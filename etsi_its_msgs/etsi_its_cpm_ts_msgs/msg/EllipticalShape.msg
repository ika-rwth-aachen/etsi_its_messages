# /** 
#  * 
#  * This DF represents the shape of an elliptical area or right elliptical cylinder that is centred on the shape's reference point. 
#  *
#  * It shall include the following components: 
#  * 
#  * @field shapeReferencePoint: optional reference point which represents the centre of the ellipse, relative to an externally specified reference position. 
#  * If this component is absent, the externally specified reference position represents the shape's  reference point. 
#  *
#  * @field semiMajorAxisLength: half length of the major axis of the ellipse.
#  * 
#  * @field semiMinorAxisLength: half length of the minor axis of the ellipse.
#  *
#  * @field orientation: the optional orientation of the major axis of the ellipse in the WGS84 coordinate system.
#  * 
#  * @field height: the optional height, present if the shape is a right elliptical cylinder extending in the positive z-axis.
#  *
#  * @category: GeoReference information
