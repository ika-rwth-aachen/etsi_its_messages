/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE represents the value of the sub cause codes of the @ref CauseCode `trafficCondition`. 
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0 `unavailable`                  - in case further detailed information on the traffic condition is unavailable,
 * - 1 `increasedVolumeOfTraffic`     - in case the type of traffic condition is increased traffic volume,
 * - 2 `trafficJamSlowlyIncreasing`   - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is increasing slowly,
 * - 3 `trafficJamIncreasing`         - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is increasing,
 * - 4 `trafficJamStronglyIncreasing` - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is strongly increasing,
 * - 5 `trafficJam`         `         - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam and no further detailed information about its volume is available,
 * - 6 `trafficJamSlightlyDecreasing` - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is decreasing slowly,
 * - 7 `trafficJamDecreasing`         - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is decreasing,
 * - 8 `trafficJamStronglyDecreasing` - in case the type of traffic condition is a traffic jam which volume is decreasing rapidly,
 * - 9 `trafficJamStable`             - in case the traffic condition is a traffic jam with stable volume,
 * - 10-255: reserved for future usage.
 *
 * @category: Traffic information
 * @revision: V1.3.1, definition of value 0 and 1 changed in V2.2.1, name and definition of value 5 changed in V2.2.1, value 9 added in V2.2.1
