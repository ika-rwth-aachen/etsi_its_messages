 * This DE indicates the duration in minutes since which something is stationary.
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0 `lessThan1Minute`         - for being stationary since less than 1 minute, 
 * - 1 `lessThan2Minutes`        - for being stationary since less than 2 minute and for equal to or more than 1 minute,
 * - 2 `lessThan15Minutes`       - for being stationary since less than 15 minutes and for equal to or more than 1 minute,
 * - 3 `equalOrGreater15Minutes` - for being stationary since equal to or more than 15 minutes.
