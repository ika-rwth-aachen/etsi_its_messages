/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE represents the type of a lane. 
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0	- `traffic`            - Lane dedicated to the movement of vehicles,
 * - 1	- `through`            - Lane dedicated to the movement of vehicles travelling ahead and not turning,
 * - 2	- `reversible`         - Lane where the direction of traffic can be changed to match the peak flow,
 * - 3	- `acceleration`	   - Lane that allows vehicles entering a road to accelerate to the speed of through traffic before merging with it,
 * - 4	- `deceleration`       - Lane that allows vehicles exiting a road to decelerate before leaving it,
 * - 5	- `leftHandTurning`    - Lane reserved for slowing down and making a left turn, so as not to disrupt traffic,
 * - 6	- `rightHandTurning`   - Lane reserved for slowing down and making a right turn so as not to disrupt traffic,
 * - 7	- `dedicatedVehicle`   - Lane dedicated to movement of motor vehicles with specific characteristics, such as heavy goods vehicles, etc., 
 * - 8	- `bus`                - Lane dedicated to movement of buses providing public transport,
 * - 9	- `taxi`               - Lane dedicated to movement of taxis,
 * - 10	- `hov`                - Carpooling lane or high occupancy vehicle lane,
 * - 11	- `hot`                - High occupancy vehicle lanes that is allowed to be used without meeting the occupancy criteria by paying a toll,
 * - 12	- `pedestrian`         - Lanes dedicated to pedestrians such as pedestrian sidewalk paths,
 * - 13	- `cycleLane`	       - Lane dedicated to exclusive or preferred use by bicycles,
 * - 14	- `median`             - Lane not dedicated to movement of vehicles but representing a median / central reservation  such as the central median, 
                                 separating the two directional carriageways of the highway,
 * - 15	- `striping`	       - Lane not dedicated to movement of vehicles but covered with roadway markings,
 * - 16	- `trackedVehicle`     - Lane dedicated to movement of trains, trams and trolleys,
 * - 17	- `parking`            - Lanes dedicated to vehicles parking, stopping and loading lanes,
 * - 18	- `emergency`          - Lane dedicated to vehicles in breakdown or to emergency vehicles also called hard shoulder,
 * - 19	- `verge`              - Lane representing the verge, i.e. a narrow strip of grass or plants and sometimes also trees located between 
                                 the road surface edge and the boundary of a road,
 * - 20	`minimumRiskManoeuvre` - Lane dedicated to automated vehicles making a minimum risk manoeuvre,
 * - 21	`separatedCycleLane`   - Lane dedicated to exclusive or preferred use by bicycles that is phyisically separated from the vehicle-traffic lanes, e.g. by a verge.
 * - values 22 to 30             reserved for future use. 
 *
 * @category: Road topology information
 * @revision: Created in V2.1.1, named value 21 added in V2.2.1
