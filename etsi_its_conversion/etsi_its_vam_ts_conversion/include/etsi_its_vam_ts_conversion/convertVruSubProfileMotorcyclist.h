/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE indicates the profile of a motorcyclist and corresponding vehicle.
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0 `unavailable `                  - to indicate that the information  is unavailable,
 * - 1 `moped`                         - to indicate a moped and rider,
 * - 2 `motorcycle`                    - to indicate a motorcycle and rider,
 * - 3 `motorcycle-and-sidecar-right`  - to indicate a motorcycle with sidecar on the right and rider,
 * - 4 `motorcycle-and-sidecar-left`   - to indicate  a motorcycle with sidecar on the left and rider.
 * - 5 to 15                           - are reserved for future usage. Value 15 is set to "max" in order to bound the size of the encoded field.
