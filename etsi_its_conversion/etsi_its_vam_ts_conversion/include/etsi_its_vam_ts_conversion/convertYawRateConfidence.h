/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE indicates the yaw rate confidence value which represents the estimated accuracy for a yaw rate value with a default confidence level of 95 %.
 * If required, the confidence level can be defined by the corresponding standards applying this DE.
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - `0` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,01 degree/second,
 * - `1` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,05 degrees/second or greater than 0,01 degree/second,
 * - `2` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 0,1 degree/second or greater than 0,05 degree/second,
 * - `3` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 1 degree/second or greater than 0,1 degree/second,
 * - `4` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 5 degrees/second or greater than 1 degrees/second,
 * - `5` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 10 degrees/second or greater than 5 degrees/second,
 * - `6` if the confidence value is equal to or less than 100 degrees/second or greater than 10 degrees/second,
 * - `7` if the confidence value is out of range, i.e. greater than 100 degrees/second,
 * - `8` if the confidence value is unavailable.
 * 
 * NOTE: The fact that a yaw rate value is received with confidence value set to `unavailable(8)` can be caused by
 * several reasons, such as:
 * - the sensor cannot deliver the accuracy at the defined confidence level because it is a low-end sensor,
 * - the sensor cannot calculate the accuracy due to lack of variables, or
 * - there has been a vehicle bus (e.g. CAN bus) error.
 * In all 3 cases above, the yaw rate value may be valid and used by the application.
 * 
 * If a yaw rate value is received and its confidence value is set to `outOfRange(7)`, it means that the 
 * yaw rate value is not valid and therefore cannot be trusted. Such value is not useful the application.
