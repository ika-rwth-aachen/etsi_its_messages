/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE represents the type of a traffic participant.
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0 `unknown`          - information about traffic participant is not provided,
 * - 1 `pedestrian`       - human being not using a mechanical device for their trip (VRU profile 1),
 * - 2 `cyclist`          - non-motorized unicycles, bicycles , tricycles, quadracycles (VRU profile 2),
 * - 3 `moped`            - light motor vehicles with less than four wheels as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class L1, L2 (VRU Profile 3),
 * - 4 `motorcycles`      - motor vehicles with less than four wheels as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class L3, L4, L5, L6, L7 (VRU Profile 3),
 * - 5 `passengerCar`     - small passenger vehicles as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class M1,
 * - 6 `bus`              - large passenger vehicles as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class M2, M3,
 * - 7 `lightTruck`       - light Goods Vehicles as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class N1,
 * - 8 `heavyTruck`       - Heavy Goods Vehicles as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class N2 and N3,
 * - 9 `trailer`          - unpowered vehicle that is intended to be towed by a powered vehicle as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class O,
 * - 10 `specialVehicles` - vehicles which have special purposes other than the above (e.g. moving road works vehicle),
 * - 11 `tram`            - vehicle which runs on tracks along public streets,
 * - 12 `lightVruVehicle` - human being traveling on light vehicle, incl. possible use of roller skates or skateboards (VRU profile 2),
 * - 13 `animal`          - animal presenting a safety risk to other road users e.g. domesticated dog in a city or horse (VRU Profile 4),
 * - 14 `agricultural`    - agricultural and forestry vehicles as defined in UNECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.4 [16] class T,
 * - 15 `roadSideUnit`    - infrastructure typically positioned outside of the drivable roadway (e.g. on a gantry, on a pole, 
                            on a stationary road works trailer); the infrastructure is static during the entire operation period of the ITS-S (e.g. no stop and go activity),
 * - 16-255               - are reserved for future usage.
 * 
 * @category: Communication information.
 * @revision: Created in V2.1.1 based on StationType
