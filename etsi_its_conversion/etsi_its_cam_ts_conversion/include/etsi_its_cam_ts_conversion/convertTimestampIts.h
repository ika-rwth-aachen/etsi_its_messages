/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE represents the number of elapsed (TAI) milliseconds since the ITS Epoch. 
 * The ITS epoch is `00:00:00.000 UTC, 1 January 2004`.
 * "Elapsed" means that the true number of milliseconds is continuously counted without interruption,
 *  i.e. it is not altered by leap seconds, which occur in UTC.
 * 
 * @note: International Atomic Time (TAI) is the time reference coordinate on the basis of the readings of atomic clocks, 
 * operated in accordance with the definition of the second, the unit of time of the International System of Units. 
 * TAI is a continuous time scale. UTC has discontinuities, as it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds. 
 * As of 1 January, 2022, TimestampIts is 5 seconds ahead of UTC, because since the ITS epoch on 1 January 2004 00:00:00.000 UTC, 
 * further 5 leap seconds have been inserted in UTC.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE: The value for TimestampIts for 1 January 2007 00:00:00.000 UTC is `94 694 401 000` milliseconds,
 * which includes one leap second insertion since the ITS epoch.
 * @unit: 0,001 s
 * @category: Basic information
 * @revision: Description revised in in V2.1.1
 *
TimestampIts ::= INTEGER (0..4398046511103)
