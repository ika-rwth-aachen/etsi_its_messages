 * This DE represents the value of the sub cause codes of the @ref CauseCode `vehicleBreakdown`. 
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0 `unavailable`         - in case further detailed information on cause of vehicle break down is unavailable,
 * - 1 `lackOfFuel`          - in case vehicle break down is due to lack of fuel,
 * - 2 `lackOfBatteryPower`  - in case vehicle break down is caused by lack of battery power,
 * - 3 `engineProblem`       - in case vehicle break down is caused by an engine problem,
 * - 4 `transmissionProblem` - in case vehicle break down is caused by transmission problem,
 * - 5 `engineCoolingProblem`- in case vehicle break down is caused by an engine cooling problem,
 * - 6 `brakingSystemProblem`- in case vehicle break down is caused by a braking system problem,
 * - 7 `steeringProblem`     - in case vehicle break down is caused by a steering problem,
 * - 8 `tyrePuncture`        - in case vehicle break down is caused by tyre puncture,
 * - 9 `tyrePressureProblem` - in case low tyre pressure in detected,
 * - 10 `vehicleOnFire`      - in case the vehicle is on fire.
 * - 11-255                  - are reserved for future usage.
