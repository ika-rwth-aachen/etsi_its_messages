/** ASN.1 Definition -----------------------------------------------------------
*
 * This DE represents the value of the sub cause codes of the @ref CauseCode `impassability`
 * 
 * The value shall be set to:
 * - 0 `unavailable`              - in case further detailed information about the unmanaged road blockage is unavailable,
 * - 1 `flooding          `       - in case the road is affected by flooding,
 * - 2 `dangerOfAvalanches`       - in case the road is at risk of being affected or blocked by avalanches,
 * - 3 `blastingOfAvalanches`     - in case there is an active blasting of avalanches on or near the road,
 * - 4 `landslips`                - in case the road is affected by landslips,
 * - 5 `chemicalSpillage`         - in case the road is affected by chemical spillage,
 * - 6 `winterClosure`            - in case the road is impassable due to a winter closure.
 * - 7 `sinkhole`                 - in case the road is impassable due to large holes in the road surface.
 * - 8 `earthquakeDamage`         - in case the road is obstructed or partially obstructed because of damage caused by an earthquake.
 * - 9 `fallenTrees`              - in case the road is obstructed or partially obstructed by one or more fallen trees. 
 * - 10 `rockfalls`               - in case the road is obstructed or partially obstructed due to fallen rocks.
 * - 11 `sewerOverflow`           - in case the road is obstructed or partially obstructed by overflows from one or more sewers. 
 * - 12 `stormDamage`             - in case the road is obstructed or partially obstructed by debris caused by strong winds.
 * - 13 `subsidence`              - in case the road surface has sunken or collapsed in places.
 * - 14 `burstPipe`               - in case the road surface has sunken or collapsed in places due to burst pipes.
 * - 15 `burstWaterMain`          - in case the road is obstructed due to local flooding and/or subsidence. 
 * - 16 `fallenPowerCables`       - in case the road is obstructed or partly obstructed by one or more fallen power cables.
 * - 17 `snowDrifts`              - in case the road is obstructed or partially obstructed by snow drifting in progress or patches of deep snow due to earlier drifting.
 * - 15-255                       - are reserved for future usage.
